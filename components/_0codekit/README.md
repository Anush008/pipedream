# Overview

The 0codekit API offers a suite of tools for developers to streamline app creation, automating backend chores, and integrating various data sources. With this API, you can manipulate databases, manage authentication, and handle file uploads without writing extensive backend code. In Pipedream, you can leverage these functionalities to create serverless workflows that react to various triggers (e.g., HTTP requests, schedules, or events from other apps) and connect to countless services with minimal effort.

## Example 0codekit Workflows on Pipedream

- Automate User Onboarding: Connect the 0codekit API with an email service like SendGrid on Pipedream. When a new user registers via 0codekit's authentication system, trigger a workflow that sends a personalized welcome email through SendGrid.

- Streamline Content Management: Integrate 0codekit with Google Sheets on Pipedream to manage content dynamically. Whenever a new row is added to a sheet, use the workflow to automatically update the content on your platform via 0codekit's database services.

- File Processing and Storage: Combine the 0codekit API with Dropbox on Pipedream. Set up a workflow where files uploaded to your app using 0codekit's file handling are automatically backed up to a Dropbox account, keeping data safe and accessible.
