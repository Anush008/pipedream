# Overview

The 46elks API lets you send and receive SMS, picture messages, and make automated voice calls straight from your apps. On Pipedream, you can weave 46elks into workflows to automate notifications, two-factor authentication, or even customer support systems. You can trigger workflows on incoming SMS, orchestrate multi-step voice interactions, and link up with other services for enhanced automation.

## Example 46elks Workflows on Pipedream

- **SMS-Based Survey with Airtable**: Automate customer feedback collection by sending SMS surveys using 46elks, and log responses directly into an Airtable base. Trigger a Pipedream workflow with each incoming message, parse the response, and save it to Airtable for analysis.

- **Dynamic Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: Strengthen security by implementing 2FA. When a user attempts to log in, trigger a Pipedream workflow that uses 46elks to send a one-time passcode via SMS. Validate the passcode in the workflow with a custom code step before granting access.

- **Real-time Order Updates via SMS and Shopify**: Send real-time order updates to customers. Set up a Pipedream workflow that listens for new order events from Shopify. For each new order, use 46elks to send a confirmation SMS to the customer, and follow up with delivery status updates when their order status changes in Shopify.
