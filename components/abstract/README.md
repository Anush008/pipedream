# Overview

Abstract - Email Verification API allows you to verify the validity of an email address in real time. This can be invaluable for maintaining clean mailing lists, ensuring user data is accurate, and avoiding bounce rates that can damage your sender reputation. In Pipedream, you can integrate this API into workflows to automate the process of email verification within your apps, sign-up forms, and user onboarding processes.

## Example Abstract - Email Verification API Workflows on Pipedream

- Validate emails on sign-up forms: Combine the API with form submission triggers from apps like Typeform or Google Forms. When a new form entry is received, the workflow triggers the Email Verification API to check the email's validity before adding it to your CRM or email marketing tool.

- Cleanse existing customer data: Schedule a regular Pipedream workflow that verifies email addresses in your customer database. Use Pipedream's SQL service or integrate with a database like PostgreSQL to fetch emails, verify them through the API, and update the status in your database.

- Protect against fraud in e-commerce: In a Pipedream workflow, add the Email Verification API as a step after a new order is placed through platforms like Shopify or WooCommerce. By verifying the email address provided for the order, you can add an additional layer of fraud protection before processing the transaction.
