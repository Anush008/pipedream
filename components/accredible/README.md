# Overview

The Accredible API lets you automate the management of digital credentials, such as issuing certificates and badges. With Pipedream, you can harness this functionality to create serverless workflows that trigger on various events. Think of sending personalized credentials post-course completion, or synchronizing credential data with your internal databases. The API enables you to create, update, retrieve, and delete credentials, as well as manage groups, designs, and more.

## Example Accredible Workflows on Pipedream

- **Automated Certificate Issuance**: Set up a workflow that triggers when a user completes a course on your learning platform. The workflow calls the Accredible API to issue a certificate and emails the user with their new credential.

- **Synchronize Credentials with CRM**: After an Accredible credential is created or updated, trigger a workflow that syncs this data with your CRM, like Salesforce, to keep sales and customer success teams informed about customer qualifications.

- **Periodic Credential Verification**: Create a workflow that periodically checks the status of issued credentials and flags any that are expiring soon. This workflow could notify administrators or credential holders directly to take necessary actions, such as renewing their certification.
