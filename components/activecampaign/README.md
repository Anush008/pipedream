# Overview

The ActiveCampaign API on Pipedream opens a world of possibilities for email marketing automation, contact management, and customer experience enhancement. With it, you can automate complex workflows, sync data across platforms, trigger targeted campaigns, and much more. This API allows you to connect your email marketing efforts with a range of other services and internal tools to streamline processes, personalize interactions, and drive engagement effectively.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate Lead Scoring Based on User Activity**: By combining ActiveCampaign with tracking tools (like Segment or a custom database), you can score leads in real-time. For instance, when a user performs specific actions on your website, a Pipedream workflow could update their lead score in ActiveCampaign, ensuring your sales team focuses on the hottest leads first.

- **Sync Contacts Between ActiveCampaign and CRM**: Pipedream can serve as a bridge between ActiveCampaign and your CRM system (like Salesforce or HubSpot). Whenever a contact is updated in your CRM, Pipedream can automatically reflect those changes in ActiveCampaign, maintaining consistency across your sales and marketing platforms.

- **Trigger Email Campaigns from External Events**: Use Pipedream to connect ActiveCampaign to event-driven services like a webinar platform (Zoom or GoToWebinar). When someone signs up for a webinar, you can automatically add them to a relevant email campaign in ActiveCampaign, ensuring they receive timely and relevant follow-up emails.
