# Overview

The Acuity Scheduling API allows you to interact programmatically with your Acuity account, creating a bridge between your scheduling data and other apps. With the API, you can automate tasks such as fetching appointment details, updating calendars, or managing client information. Integrating the Acuity Scheduling API into Pipedream workflows lets you connect these capabilities with hundreds of other services to streamline processes, react to scheduling events in real-time, and enhance client engagement.

# Example Use Cases

- **Appointment Confirmation via SMS**: When a new appointment is booked in Acuity, trigger a Pipedream workflow to send a confirmation SMS through Twilio. This workflow can include details like date, time, and preparation instructions.

- **Sync New Appointments to Google Calendar**: Use Pipedream to monitor for new Acuity appointments and automatically create corresponding events in a Google Calendar, keeping all your schedules in sync without manual entry.

- **Automated Follow-Up Emails Post-Appointment**: After an appointment is completed in Acuity Scheduling, Pipedream can trigger an email sequence through SendGrid, thanking clients for their visit and perhaps offering a discount on their next booking.
