# Overview

The Adalo API provides a powerful gateway to build and manage custom applications without in-depth coding knowledge. With Adalo's API, you can manipulate your app's data, trigger actions within the app, and integrate with external services. On Pipedream, you can leverage this connectivity to automate workflows, sync data across various platforms, and extend the functionality of your Adalo apps. The APIâ€™s capabilities allow you to create, read, update, and delete records, making it a versatile tool for workflow automation.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate User Onboarding**: When a new user signs up on your Adalo app, you can set up a Pipedream workflow that automatically sends a personalized welcome email via SendGrid, adds the user to a CRM like Salesforce, and schedules a follow-up task in Asana.

- **Content Synchronization**: Keep your Adalo app content fresh by automating content updates. When a new blog post is published in WordPress, a Pipedream workflow can be triggered to create a corresponding record in your Adalo app, ensuring your users always have access to the latest content.

- **Order Processing**: Streamline the order processing for your Adalo e-commerce app. When a new order is placed, use Pipedream to capture the order details, generate an invoice with Stripe, send a confirmation message to the customer using Twilio SMS, and update inventory records in your database.
