# Overview

The AddEvent API allows users to create and manage events across various calendar services seamlessly. Integrating this API with Pipedream, you can automate the process of event management, connect with other services for enhanced functionality, and sync with your database or CRM system. This could streamline your workflow for setting up events, sending reminders, or following up with attendees post-event.

## Example addevent Workflows on Pipedream

- **Automated Event Creation and Reminder System:** Use the AddEvent API on Pipedream to automatically create events from a Google Sheets spreadsheet that tracks your upcoming webinars. Then, set up reminders to be sent via Twilio SMS to registered participants a day before the event.

- **Dynamic Calendar Syncing with CRM:** Connect AddEvent with Salesforce on Pipedream. Whenever a new lead is added to Salesforce, an introductory call event is created using AddEvent, and the details are synced back to Salesforce to ensure your sales team has the most up-to-date calendar.

- **Event Feedback Collection Workflow:** After an event concludes, trigger a workflow on Pipedream using AddEvent that sends an email using SendGrid to all attendees asking for feedback. Collect the responses in a Google Form, which then updates a specific Google Sheet for analysis.
