# Overview

The ADP API on Pipedream allows you to automate various HR and payroll tasks, enabling efficient management of employee data and financial processes. By leveraging the ADP API, you can construct workflows that react to business events, synchronize employee information across systems, automate payroll processes, and more. Pipedream's serverless platform simplifies connecting ADP to hundreds of other apps, allowing you to create custom automations that fit your unique business needs without managing infrastructure.

## Example ADP Workflows on Pipedream

- Sync new employee records in ADP to an HR management system like BambooHR. When a new employee is added in ADP, trigger a Pipedream workflow that creates or updates their profile in BambooHR, ensuring consistent data across platforms.

- Monitor changes in employee work hours logged in ADP and post summaries to a Slack channel weekly. This helps teams stay informed of workload and overtime trends, potentially improving resource planning and management.

- When payroll is processed in ADP, trigger a workflow that captures the details and creates an entry in QuickBooks for financial reconciliation. By linking ADP to QuickBooks, you streamline the accounting process with less room for error and more time saved.
