# Overview

The AEvent API allows you to automate interactions with your event management. Integrating this API on Pipedream enables you to craft custom workflows that can streamline event creation, management, and analysis. You could, for instance, connect AEvent to registration platforms, send out automated emails or notifications, sync event details to your calendar, or gather attendee feedback into a central database. With Pipedream's serverless platform, you can trigger workflows on a schedule, upon new event creation, or when registration statuses change, making your event management process more efficient and responsive.

## Example AEvent Workflows on Pipedream

1. **Automated Event Creation and Notification**: When a new event is planned, use the AEvent API to create the event in AEvent, then utilize Pipedreamâ€™s built-in email service to send notifications to all potential attendees.

2. **Sync Registrations with CRM**: As new attendees register for an event, trigger a Pipedream workflow that adds or updates their contact information in a CRM like Salesforce, ensuring your sales team has the latest leads to follow up on.

3. **Post-Event Feedback Collection**: After an event concludes, trigger a workflow that sends out a feedback survey using Typeform or Google Forms, and collects responses in a Google Sheet for easy analysis and follow-up.
