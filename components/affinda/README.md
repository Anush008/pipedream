# Overview

Affinda is an API that offers advanced document processing capabilities. On Pipedream, you can leverage Affinda to extract data from resumes, identify key elements in invoices, or handle custom document analysis. By connecting Affinda with other services on Pipedream, you can automate workflows like parsing incoming resumes to filter candidates, processing invoices for financial insights, or routing documents based on their content.

## Example Affindda Workflows on Pipedream

1. **Resume Screening Automation**: Connect Affinda to your email app on Pipedream to automatically process resumes received as email attachments. Extracted data such as experience, education, and skills can trigger custom logic to rank and sort candidates, which is then saved to a Google Sheet for review.

2. **Invoice Processing System**: Use Affinda with the Dropbox app to scan for new invoice uploads. Affinda extracts key invoice data like totals, tax amounts, and vendor details, which is then entered into an accounting software like QuickBooks for streamlined bookkeeping.

3. **Document Routing Based on Content**: Combine Affinda with Slack on Pipedream. When a new document is added to a monitored folder in a service like SharePoint or Google Drive, Affinda analyzes the content and sends a Slack message to the relevant department or team member based on the document's type or content.
