# Overview

AfterShip's API offers robust tracking and post-purchase optimization options. On Pipedream, you can leverage this API to automate workflows that keep your customers informed about their shipments, sync tracking data with other services, and monitor delivery updates efficiently. With AfterShip integrated into Pipedream, you can create workflows that trigger on shipment status changes, extract data for analytics, or notify customers and teams through various communication platforms.

## Example AfterShip Workflows on Pipedream

1. **New Shipment Status to Slack Notification**: Trigger a Pipedream workflow whenever a shipment status updates on AfterShip, then send a formatted message to a Slack channel notifying the team or customer about the delivery status. This keeps everyone updated in real-time without manual checks.

2. **Order Data Sync to Google Sheets**: Whenever a new order is tracked in AfterShip, automatically append the tracking details to a Google Sheets spreadsheet. This can serve as a central log for all shipments, making it simpler to manage orders and analyze shipping performance over time.

3. **Customer Follow-Up Emails with SendGrid**: Set up a workflow that triggers when a delivery is marked as 'Delivered' on AfterShip. Use this trigger to send a follow-up email through SendGrid, asking for feedback or offering a discount on future purchases. This encourages customer engagement and repeat business.
