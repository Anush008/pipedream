# Overview

Agiled is a business management platform designed to streamline operations like CRM, HR, finance, and project management. Leveraging Agiled's API within Pipedream, you can automate actions such as managing contacts, creating tasks, sending invoices, or syncing project data. Pipedream's serverless execution environment allows you to connect Agiled with hundreds of other apps to create powerful, automated workflows, making it simpler to integrate Agiled's capabilities into your existing business processes.

## Example Agiled Workflows on Pipedream

1. **CRM Lead to Agile Project**: Automatically create a new project in Agiled when a new lead is added to your CRM tool, like Salesforce. Use Pipedream's Salesforce trigger to detect the new lead, then create a project in Agiled with the relevant details.

2. **Task Creation on Calendar Event**: Create tasks in Agiled from new Google Calendar events. Set up a Pipedream workflow that triggers on new calendar events and uses the Agiled API to create corresponding tasks, ensuring your project tasks are aligned with your schedule.

3. **Invoice Generation from Slack Command**: Generate and send invoices through Agiled using a custom Slack slash command. When the command is used in Slack, Pipedream intercepts it and triggers a workflow that creates an invoice in Agiled, streamlining the billing process directly from your communication platform.
