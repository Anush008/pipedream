# Overview

The Ahrefs API provides programmatic access to Ahrefs' vast data on SEO metrics, enabling developers to pull in information related to website rankings, link profiles, and content performance. Within Pipedream, you can leverage these insights for SEO monitoring, competitive analysis, and automated reporting. With its serverless platform, Pipedream simplifies the integration of Ahrefs data into custom workflows, triggering actions in other apps, managing data transformations, and automating repetitive tasks with powerful, code-driven solutions.

# Example Use Cases

- **SEO Dashboard Creation**: Craft a workflow that periodically fetches key SEO metrics from Ahrefs and populates a Google Sheets spreadsheet. Use this as a live SEO dashboard to monitor changes in the rankings, backlink profiles, and organic search traffic for your website.

- **Competitor Alerting System**: Set up a Pipedream workflow to track competitors' new backlinks detected by Ahrefs. Use this data to send alerts through apps like Slack or email so your marketing team can quickly analyze and respond to competitors' backlink strategies.

- **Content Performance Tracker**: Create a workflow that pulls the latest content rankings from Ahrefs for specific keywords and sends a weekly digest to content creators and stakeholders. Use this to inform content strategy decisions and measure content performance over time.
