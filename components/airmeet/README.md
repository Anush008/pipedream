# Overview

The Airmeet API lets you tap into your event, conference, and webinar data, and when used with Pipedream, you can automate workflows around your Airmeet activities. Imagine syncing attendee information with your CRM, sending personalized follow-up emails, or getting real-time insights from event engagement. With Pipedream's serverless platform, you can create these customized automations without managing infrastructure, using Airmeet's event-driven data as a trigger or part of your workflow logic.

## Example Airmeet Workflows on Pipedream

- When a new attendee registers for an Airmeet event, add their details to a Google Sheet and send a customized welcome email using SendGrid. This keeps a record and personally engages each new participant.

- After an Airmeet session ends, trigger a workflow that collects feedback by sending a Typeform survey to all participants, then store their responses in a MySQL database for analysis and future event improvement.

- Sync Airmeet attendee data with Salesforce CRM. When an attendee joins an event, check if the participant exists in Salesforce, and if not, create a new lead. This ensures your sales team has up-to-date information for follow-ups.
