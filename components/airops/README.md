# Overview

The AirOps API offers a suite of tools for managing aviation operations, including flight scheduling, aircraft management, and crew coordination. On Pipedream, you can tap into these capabilities to automate your aviation workflow, synchronize data across platforms, and enhance efficiency with real-time updates. By crafting serverless workflows, you can trigger actions based on events in AirOps, process data, and connect with countless other services seamlessly.

## Example AirOps Workflows on Pipedream

- **Automated Flight Status Notifications**: Use the AirOps API to monitor flight statuses and automatically send updates via Slack messages or emails when there are changes. Connect AirOps with the Slack app on Pipedream to notify crew and passengers promptly.

- **Maintenance Schedule Sync**: Set up a workflow that fetches aircraft maintenance schedules from AirOps and syncs them with Google Calendar. This ensures that all relevant staff are aware of upcoming maintenance events, and any changes in AirOps reflect on the shared calendar without manual updates.

- **Crew Availability Management**: Implement a system where crew availability from AirOps is cross-referenced with an internal database (using Pipedream's SQL or Data Stores) to automate the assignment of crew to flights. If a crew memberâ€™s availability changes, the workflow can update assignments and notify the operations team.
