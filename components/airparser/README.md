# Overview

The Airparser API transforms unstructured data into structured data, perfect for automating data extraction from emails, documents, and webpages. When combined with Pipedream's serverless platform, you can create workflows that automatically parse incoming data and integrate with countless other services for seamless data processing. From extracting order info from emails for e-commerce automation to processing registration forms for events, Airparser on Pipedream simplifies data extraction tasks.

## Example Airparser Workflows on Pipedream

1. **Email Order Processing**: Automatically parse order details from customer emails. When a new email is received in Gmail, trigger a Pipedream workflow, use Airparser to extract order details, and then save this structured data to a Google Sheets spreadsheet for easy order tracking.

2. **Customer Support Ticket Creation**: Streamline support by parsing customer enquiry emails to create support tickets. Set up a Pipedream workflow that triggers upon receiving an email, use Airparser to extract relevant details, and create a ticket in Zendesk with the structured data.

3. **Lead Information Capture**: Enhance lead management by parsing information from potential leads that come from multiple sources. Configure a Pipedream workflow to listen for new submissions from a web form, parse the submission content with Airparser, and then add the lead details directly to a CRM platform like Salesforce.
