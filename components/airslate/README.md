# Overview

The Airslate API allows you to automate document workflows, create and manage electronic signatures, and control your document flow with event notifications. On Pipedream, you can harness these capabilities to create serverless workflows integrating various apps, streamlining how documents are prepared, signed, and acted on. It's a powerful toolkit for businesses looking to automate their paperwork processes.

## Example Airslate Workflows on Pipedream

- **Automated Document Workflow Initialization**: Trigger a workflow on Pipedream with a new form submission from a site like Typeform, creating a new document flow in Airslate, pre-filled with the submission data, and send it out for an electronic signature.

- **Dynamic Contract Creation and Management**: Use Pipedream to watch for new customer entries in a CRM like Salesforce, automatically generate personalized contracts in Airslate, and upon completion, update the CRM record with the status of the contract.

- **Document Status Webhooks to Notifications**: Set up a Pipedream workflow that listens for Airslate webhook events indicating a change in document status, such as a completed signature, and then sends a customized alert to a Slack channel or an email via SendGrid to keep relevant parties informed in real-time.
