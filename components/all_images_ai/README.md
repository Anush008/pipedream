# Overview

The All-Images.ai API allows users to manipulate and analyze images with AI-based features. Using Pipedream, you can automate workflows that include image recognition, categorization, or modifications. This functionality is especially handy for apps that deal with large volumes of images and require efficient, automatic processing.

## Example All-Images.ai Workflows on Pipedream

- **Automated Image Tagging for CMS**: Trigger a workflow whenever a new image is uploaded to a CMS (like WordPress). Use All-Images.ai to analyze and tag the image content, then update the CMS with these tags for improved SEO and searchability.

- **Content Moderation for Social Media Platforms**: Connect All-Images.ai with a social media platform (like Twitter). Monitor posts for new images, use the API to detect any inappropriate content, and automatically alert moderators or take down violating images.

- **E-commerce Product Catalog Enhancement**: Integrate All-Images.ai with an e-commerce platform like Shopify. Whenever a new product image is added, run it through the API to enhance image quality, add watermarks, and generate alternative text descriptions for improved accessibility and user experience.
