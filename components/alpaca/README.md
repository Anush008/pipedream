# Overview

The Alpaca API allows you to integrate with Alpaca's commission-free stock brokerage platform directly from Pipedream. You can leverage this API to manage portfolios, automate trading strategies, and get real-time market data. With Pipedream's serverless platform, you can build workflows that react to various market events, perform trades based on custom algorithms, and connect with other apps for enhanced financial analytics or notifications.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Trading Bot**: Create a workflow that executes trades automatically based on predefined criteria, such as stock price movements or technical indicators. By triggering this workflow at regular intervals or in response to market data changes, you can maintain an active trading strategy with minimal manual intervention.

- **Portfolio Rebalancing Reminder**: Set up a workflow that monitors your portfolio's asset allocation and sends you email alerts when it's time to rebalance. Connect Alpaca with Pipedream's built-in email service to ensure you're maintaining your desired investment strategy.

- **Real-Time Alerts for Stock Events**: Implement a workflow that uses Alpaca to watch for significant stock events like earnings reports, dividends, or price spikes. When an event is detected, the workflow could send a notification through a service like Slack, keeping you up-to-date on important market happenings.
