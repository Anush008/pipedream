# Overview

The Alpaca API on Pipedream provides a powerful avenue for automating stock trading tasks, accessing market data, and managing portfolios with the ease of serverless workflows. Via Pipedream’s low-code integration platform, users can leverage Alpaca’s capabilities to execute trades, monitor stock positions, and react to market changes in real-time. With Pipedream, the Alpaca API can be connected to an array of other apps and services to create complex automations without the need for a dedicated backend infrastructure.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Trading Bot**: Create a serverless trading bot that executes buys and sells based on predefined criteria. For instance, use Alpaca to monitor stock prices and trigger trades when certain conditions are met, like a specific price target or a technical indicator signal.

- **Portfolio Rebalancing**: Set up a workflow that periodically checks your investment portfolio and rebalances asset allocations. Connect Alpaca to Pipedream’s cron scheduler to assess portfolio drift and execute trades to maintain your desired asset mix.

- **Slack Alerts for Market Events**: Craft a system that sends real-time notifications to a Slack channel in response to significant market events affecting your portfolio. This could be done by hooking Alpaca to listen for price movements and then using the Slack app on Pipedream to dispatch alerts to keep you, or your team, informed.
