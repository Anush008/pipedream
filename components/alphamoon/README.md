# Overview

Alphamoon API provides advanced artificial intelligence capabilities that allow you to automate and optimize document processing tasks. With it, you can extract data from various document types, convert spoken language into text, and enhance image quality. On Pipedream, you can leverage these features to build serverless workflows that interact with other apps, perform actions based on document analysis, and streamline data processing tasks without the need for complex infrastructure.

## Example Alphamoon Workflows on Pipedream

1. **Automated Invoice Processing**: Create a workflow where invoices received via Gmail are automatically forwarded to Alphamoon for data extraction. The extracted data (such as invoice number, totals, and line items) is then formatted and inserted into a Google Sheets spreadsheet for accounting purposes.

2. **Customer Onboarding Document Validation**: Set up a workflow that triggers when a new document is uploaded to a Dropbox folder. The document is sent to Alphamoon to verify and extract personal information, which is then checked against a CRM like Salesforce to ensure consistency and completeness of customer records.

3. **Real-time Meeting Transcription and Analysis**: Configure a workflow where audio recordings from Zoom meetings are passed to Alphamoon for transcription. The resulting text can be analyzed for keywords and sentiment, with important action items and summaries pushed to a Slack channel for team collaboration and follow-up.
