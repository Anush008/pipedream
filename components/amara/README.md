# Overview

The Amara API offers a powerful way to interact with the Amara platform, enabling programmatic access to services like video captioning, translation, and subtitle management. Integrating Amara with Pipedream allows you to automate workflows around video subtitling, such as syncing subtitles across platforms, triggering actions when new subtitles are added, or managing translation projects. With Pipedream's ability to connect to hundreds of apps, you can easily trigger workflows from other services, process subtitle data, and even automate notifications or content updates across your toolchain.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate Subtitle Synchronization**: When a new subtitle is created in Amara, trigger a Pipedream workflow to automatically update the subtitles on related platforms like YouTube or Vimeo. This ensures that all video content remains accessible and up-to-date across all channels.

- **Translation Project Management**: Use Pipedream to monitor the status of translation projects on Amara. When a translation is completed, the workflow can notify team members via Slack or email, create a task in a project management tool like Trello, or update a database with the new translation details for tracking purposes.

- **Content Aggregation & Analysis**: Collect and analyze subtitles and translations from Amara for content research. A Pipedream workflow can be set up to fetch new subtitles, extract keywords or phrases for SEO purposes, and push this data into a Google Sheets document or a BigQuery dataset for further analysis.
