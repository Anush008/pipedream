# Overview

The Amazon Alexa API on Pipedream allows you to integrate and automate tasks for Alexa-enabled devices. You can create voice-driven capabilities, set up custom interactions, and access user and device data, leveraging Alexa's smart functionalities. Pipedreamâ€™s serverless platform enables you to connect Alexa with other services to create intricate workflows, ranging from sending daily briefings to your Slack channel to automating smart home devices based on voice commands.

## Example Amazon Alexa Workflows on Pipedream

- **Alexa Flash Briefing to Slack**: Set up a workflow where Alexa's flash briefing is automatically sent to a Slack channel every morning, keeping your team informed on the latest news without them having to ask Alexa.

- **Voice-Triggered Email Notifications**: Create a workflow that sends an email via SendGrid when a specific voice command is given to Alexa. For instance, saying "Alexa, trigger email update" could send a summary of your upcoming calendar events from Google Calendar to your inbox.

- **Smart Home Automation Logs**: Integrate Alexa with smart home devices and log all voice-activated actions in a Google Sheets spreadsheet. This could track when lights are turned on/off or the temperature is changed, offering insights into usage patterns and helping in energy management.
