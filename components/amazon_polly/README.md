# Overview

Amazon Polly is a cloud service that converts text into lifelike speech, enabling you to create applications that talk and build entirely new categories of speech-enabled products. Through Pipedream, you can leverage the Amazon Polly API to automate various aspects of voice generation. Think about integrating voice notifications into your systems, generating audio content from written material, or creating interactive voice response systems for customer support. Pipedream's serverless platform makes these integrations simple, offering triggers and actions to connect Polly with hundreds of other apps for seamless workflows.

## Example Amazon Polly Workflows on Pipedream

- **Content Creation and Distribution**: Automatically convert blog posts into audio files using Amazon Polly, then distribute them directly to platforms like SoundCloud or Spotify. This can help in reaching a broader audience that prefers listening over reading.
- **Voice Alerts System**: Set up a system that monitors website uptime or application performance and uses Amazon Polly to send voice notifications via Twilio or another telephony service if something goes wrong. This can be especially useful for critical alerts that need to stand out.
- **Customer Support Automation**: Create a workflow where customer submitted tickets are converted to speech with Amazon Polly and then played over the phone using services like Twilio. It can help in triaging support tickets and providing immediate acknowledgements, improving customer service efficiency.
