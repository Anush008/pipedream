# Overview

Amazon Simple Email Service (SES) is a cloud-based email sending service designed to help digital marketers and application developers send marketing, notification, and transactional emails. On Pipedream, you can leverage the Amazon SES API to create powerful, serverless workflows for sending emails, processing incoming messages, and managing sender reputations. By integrating with other apps and services, you can automate email-related tasks, enhance your marketing campaigns, and streamline communication processes without writing extensive code.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Customer Support Tickets**: When a customer sends an email to a support address, Amazon SES receives the message, and Pipedream triggers a workflow that creates a new ticket in a support system like Zendesk or Jira, enabling timely and organized customer support.

- **Email Marketing Automation**: Combine Amazon SES with a CRM app like HubSpot on Pipedream. Automatically send personalized marketing emails or newsletters to a segmented list of contacts whenever a new contact is added to a specific stage in your sales pipeline.

- **Real-time Email Analytics**: Use Amazon SES to send emails and track their delivery status. Connect SES with a database on Pipedream, such as PostgreSQL, to log this data, or integrate with a data visualization tool like Google Sheets or Tableau to generate real-time analytics dashboards for monitoring your email campaignsâ€™ performance.
