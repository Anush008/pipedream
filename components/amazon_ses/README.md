# Overview

With the Amazon SES API on Pipedream, you can craft email-centric workflows for sending, receiving, and tracking email delivery. The API allows you to programmatically send emails, manage sender identities, filter incoming messages, and integrate with other AWS services. By harnessing the power of serverless on Pipedream, you can build automations that react to various triggers, orchestrate data flows between apps, and handle complex email operations without provisioning infrastructure.

# Example Use Cases

- **Transactional Email System**: Automate the sending of transactional emails based on user actions. For example, when a user completes a purchase on your e-commerce platform, trigger a Pipedream workflow that uses Amazon SES to send a confirmation email.

- **Email Bounce Handling**: Create a workflow that monitors your Amazon SES bounce and complaint notifications. Integrate with a CRM like Salesforce to automatically update contact lists and maintain email deliverability.

- **Automated Email Campaigns**: Combine Amazon SES with a scheduling tool like Google Calendar. Set up a Pipedream workflow that triggers sending of a new marketing email via SES whenever a new event is created on your marketing calendar.
