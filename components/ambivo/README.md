# Overview

The Ambivo API enables you to automate interactions with a range of web services, including video conferencing, messaging, and email. With Pipedream, you can craft serverless workflows that leverage Ambivo's capabilities, such as triggering video calls, sending automated emails, or managing contacts and appointments. By connecting Ambivo to other apps via Pipedream, you can build powerful automations that streamline communication and collaboration processes.

## Example Ambivo Workflows on Pipedream

- Set up a workflow that triggers a video conference call in Ambivo whenever a new event is scheduled in your Google Calendar. After the event is created, an email invitation can be sent to all participants using Ambivo's email service.

- Create a serverless function on Pipedream that listens for new messages in a Slack channel. When a specific keyword is detected, the workflow sends an automated response via Ambivo's messaging service to provide immediate engagement.

- Implement a workflow that automatically adds new sign-ups from a Typeform survey to Ambivo's contact management system. Additionally, set up a follow-up email sequence in Ambivo for nurturing leads, all triggered by the Typeform submission.
