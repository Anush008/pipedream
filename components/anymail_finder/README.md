2. **CRM Integration for Sales**: Upon receiving a new contact form submission on your website, the workflow activates to find and validate the submitter's email with Anymail Finder, then pushes the validated contact data to your Salesforce CRM, keeping your sales team equipped with reliable info.

3. **Automated Outreach Campaign**: A scheduled workflow that extracts domain names from a database, uses Anymail Finder to gather and validate corresponding emails, and then inputs these into a SendGrid email sequence, launching an outreach campaign with high deliverability.
