# Overview

Apify API allows you to harness the power of web scraping and automation directly from Pipedream. With Apify, you can create workflows that extract data from web pages, run crawlers, or execute JavaScript in a cloud-based environment. You can automate tasks that involve data collection, processing, and migration, and connect these tasks with various other apps integrated within Pipedream to design robust, serverless data pipelines.

# Example Use Cases

- **Web Data Extraction to Google Sheets**: Automate the scraping of structured data from websites using Apify's actors and push this data into Google Sheets. This workflow can be used for market research, price monitoring, or lead generation.

- **Scheduled Content Backup**: Configure a routine that utilizes Apify to crawl websites and back up content at specified intervals. Store the collected data in cloud storage solutions like Dropbox or AWS S3, ensuring your data is up-to-date and secure.

- **Real-time Slack Notifications for New Leads**: Set up a trigger that activates an Apify actor to monitor a website for changes or new content. Once a change is detected, parse the lead information and send a notification with the details to a Slack channel, keeping your team instantly informed about potential business opportunities.
