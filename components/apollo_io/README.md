- **Sync Leads With Email Campaigns**: Create a workflow that listens for new leads or contacts added to Apollo.io, then automatically adds those contacts to an email marketing app like Mailchimp or SendGrid, facilitating seamless integration between your prospecting and email campaign tools.

- **Lead Scoring and Prioritization**: Employ a workflow that uses the Apollo.io API to score leads based on custom criteria such as company size, industry, or technology stack. Connect this to a platform like Salesforce or HubSpot to update lead scores, helping your sales team prioritize their outreach efforts.
