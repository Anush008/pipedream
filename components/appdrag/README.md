# Overview

AppDrag is a cloud-based development platform that provides a range of tools for building and hosting web applications. With the AppDrag API, you can automate tasks such as managing your projects, deploying updates, handling databases, and integrating cloud functions. Pipedream acts as a glue for these APIs, providing an environment to create automated workflows for your development processes or to connect AppDrag with other services for enhanced functionality.

## Example AppDrag Workflows on Pipedream

- **Automatic Deployment Trigger**: On every push to your GitHub repository, set up a Pipedream workflow that triggers a deployment of your AppDrag project. This will ensure your AppDrag app is always up to date with your latest code changes.
- **Database Backup Notifications**: Schedule a daily workflow in Pipedream to call the AppDrag API to back up your database. Then, use the Twilio API to send an SMS to your phone to confirm the backup has been performed.
- **Content Update and Social Media Alert**: Whenever you update content on your AppDrag site, trigger a Pipedream workflow that pushes a notification of the update to your Slack channel, and then posts an update to your Twitter account using the Twitter API to keep your followers informed.
