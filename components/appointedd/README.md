# Overview

The Appointedd API enables you to manage bookings, customers, and schedules through programmatic means. With Pipedream, you can harness this power to automate your booking process, sync with your existing services, and trigger actions based on booking events. For instance, you could automatically send customized emails after a booking is made, sync bookings with a Google Calendar, or update customer records in a CRM.

## Example Appointedd Workflows on Pipedream

- **Automated Booking Confirmation Emails**: After a booking is created via Appointedd, trigger a Pipedream workflow that sends a personalized confirmation email to the customer using SendGrid or another email service.

- **Sync Bookings to Google Calendar**: Use the Appointedd API to monitor new bookings and update a Google Calendar with the booking details, ensuring all appointments are visible across your teamsâ€™ calendars.

- **CRM Customer Sync**: When a new customer is added to Appointedd, a workflow could trigger that creates or updates a corresponding customer record in a CRM like HubSpot, Salesforce, or Zoho CRM, keeping customer data in sync.
