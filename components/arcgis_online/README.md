# Overview

The ArcGIS Online API lets you integrate a rich set of geographic information system (GIS) capabilities with your apps. On Pipedream, you can harness this API to automate tasks like updating maps, managing users, and analyzing spatial data. It pairs well with other data sources and tools for a full-fledged automation setup.

## Example ArcGIS Online Workflows on Pipedream

- **Automated Map Data Updates**: Create a workflow that triggers on a schedule to fetch new data from an external database (like PostgreSQL) and update a feature layer on an ArcGIS map. This keeps the map data fresh without manual intervention.

- **User Management Automation**: Set up a workflow that listens to webhook events from a user management platform (like Okta). When a user's status changes, the workflow updates the corresponding user roles and permissions in ArcGIS Online, ensuring proper access control.

- **Spatial Data Analysis Trigger**: Combine ArcGIS Online with a data analysis tool (like Python via AWS Lambda). Trigger the workflow when new spatial data is uploaded to ArcGIS. Then, process the data with the analysis tool and store results in ArcGIS or another app like Google Sheets for easy reporting.
