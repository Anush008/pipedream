# Overview

The arXiv API provides programmatic access to the vast trove of scientific papers hosted on arXiv.org, spanning fields like physics, mathematics, computer science, quantitative biology, quantitative finance, statistics, electrical engineering, systems science, and economics. With this API, you can search, fetch, and leverage metadata for articles in the arXiv repository. When used within Pipedream, you can automate workflows such as monitoring new submissions on specific topics, analyzing trends in scientific research, or integrating with other data sources to enrich the information on a certain study area.

## Example arXiv Workflows on Pipedream

1. Create a workflow that triggers daily, searches for new papers related to machine learning using the arXiv API, and posts the results to a Slack channel for easy team review and discussion.

2. Set up a workflow where the arXiv API feeds new publications into a Google Sheets spreadsheet, categorizing them by subject area and including links, for a constantly updated database of research material.

3. Design a workflow that listens for new arXiv submissions in the field of quantum computing, parses the metadata, and then uses the SendGrid app to distribute a curated newsletter to subscribers.
