# Overview

The Asana API on Pipedream offers a cornucopia of automation opportunities to streamline project management tasks. With Pipedream's serverless platform, you can craft workflows that respond to events in Asana or manipulate your Asana data in response to events from other sources. These automations can help you synchronize project data, automate repetitive tasks, and connect Asana with other tools in your stack, such as GitHub for code management, Slack for communication, or Google Sheets for reporting.

# Example Use Cases

- **Task Creation Automation from Email**: Automate the creation of Asana tasks from incoming emails. Each time you receive an email that fits certain criteria (like from a specific domain or containing a keyword), Pipedream triggers a workflow that parses the email and creates a new task in a specified Asana project.

- **GitHub Commit Trigger for Asana Updates**: Keep your Asana tasks in sync with your codebase. Every time a commit is pushed to a specific GitHub repository, Pipedream can trigger a workflow that updates a related task in Asana, such as marking it as completed or adding a comment with the commit details.

- **Daily Slack Reminders of Asana Tasks**: Start your team's day off right with a summary of tasks. Each morning, Pipedream can trigger a workflow that retrieves tasks due that day from Asana and sends a formatted message to a designated Slack channel, ensuring that everyone's on the same page and focused on the day's priorities.
