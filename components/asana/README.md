# Overview

The Asana API facilitates the creation and management of projects, tasks, and workflows within the Asana app. With Pipedream, you can harness this capability to automate and integrate your project management activities. You can trigger workflows based on events in Asana, such as new tasks being created or completed, and you can perform actions like updating tasks or adding comments. By connecting Asana with other apps, you can construct a centralized automation hub that encourages productivity and synchronicity across your tools and team.

# Example Use Cases

- **Task Completion Notifications**: Send a notification to a Slack channel whenever a task is marked as completed in Asana. This keeps the team updated in real-time about project progress and encourages recognition of completed work.

- **GitHub Issue Synchronization**: Whenever a new GitHub issue is created, automatically generate a corresponding task in an Asana project. Further, when the Asana task is marked complete, update the status of the GitHub issue. This links development workflows with project management, ensuring alignment and tracking.

- **Daily Task Digest Emails**: Compile a list of tasks created or modified in the last 24 hours and send a daily summary email to relevant stakeholders. This workflow can be extended to filter tasks by project or assignee, ensuring personalized and relevant updates.
