# Overview

The ASIN Data API is a service that allows users to retrieve detailed information about products listed on Amazon, using their Amazon Standard Identification Numbers (ASINs). By leveraging this API, you can access product details, offer listings, and competitive pricing, which can be vital for businesses that need up-to-date information for market analysis, price monitoring, or maintaining product catalogs. Within Pipedream, you can automate workflows that respond to various triggers, such as new product listings, price changes, or stock level updates.

## Example ASIN Data API Workflows on Pipedream

- Obtain product details when a new item is added to an Amazon wishlist. Use this data to create a notification service that alerts you or your customers about product availability or pricing on various platforms.
- Set up a workflow that monitors price changes for a set of products by scheduling regular ASIN Data API checks. When a price drops below a certain threshold, trigger an automatic email to a list of subscribers using Pipedream's integrated email service.
- Build a stock level tracker by regularly calling the ASIN Data API to check inventory status. If the stock for a particular product falls below a specified level, generate a restock request and send it to a supplier management system like QuickBooks or directly to your inventory management dashboard.
