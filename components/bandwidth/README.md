# Overview

The Bandwidth API provides a powerful platform for building voice and messaging functionalities within applications. With Pipedream, you can harness this capability to automate communications, streamline notifications, and integrate with other services. Whether you're automating SMS responses, setting up dynamic call forwarding, or sending alerts, Pipedream turns complex tasks into scalable workflows with minimal code.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated SMS Notifications**: Trigger an SMS notification through Bandwidth when a specific event occurs in another app, such as a new lead in Salesforce or a high-priority ticket in Zendesk. This keeps teams immediately informed and responsive to important events.

- **Dynamic Call Routing**: Use Pipedream to create a serverless workflow that processes incoming calls via Bandwidth, cross-references caller information with a CRM like HubSpot, and routes the call to the appropriate agent based on customer data or inquiry type.

- **Real-time Alert System**: Set up a workflow that monitors website uptime with a tool like UptimeRobot and utilizes Bandwidth to make voice calls or send SMS messages to a list of administrators when the site goes down, ensuring quick reaction to outages.
