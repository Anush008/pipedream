# Overview

The Bandwidth API on Pipedream enables seamless integration with Bandwidth's communication platform, offering powerful automation capabilities for voice, messaging, and 911 access. With this API, you can automate sending and receiving SMS messages, manage voice calls, and handle emergency call routing. Pipedream's serverless environment allows you to connect Bandwidth with hundreds of other apps to create dynamic workflows that can respond to events in real-time without the need for a dedicated backend infrastructure.

# Example Use Cases

- **SMS Customer Support Automation**: Automate your customer support by receiving SMS messages with Bandwidth and using Pipedream to triage messages based on content, intent, or urgency. You could connect to a CRM like Salesforce to log conversations or to a translation service to handle multilingual support.

- **Voice Alert Broadcasting**: Use Bandwidth to broadcast voice alerts based on triggers from monitoring services like Datadog or New Relic. Set up a Pipedream workflow that initiates a Bandwidth voice call to deliver critical status updates or warnings to a list of subscribers whenever your monitoring systems detect an issue.

- **Dynamic 911 Call Routing**: Build a system that dynamically routes emergency calls using Bandwidth's 911 API. Pipedream can integrate with IoT platforms or GPS services to capture the caller's location and forward that data to Bandwidth to ensure that calls are routed to the nearest emergency response center.
