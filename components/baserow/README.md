# Overview

The Baserow API unlocks the potential to create, read, update, and delete records within your Baserow database, a customizable and user-friendly open-source online database tool. Integrating Baserow with Pipedream allows you to automate workflows, sync data across different platforms, and trigger actions based on database updates. Whether managing CRM data, tracking project tasks, or collating survey results, the API coupled with Pipedream's serverless platform facilitates seamless automation and data manipulation.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated CRM Updates**: Use Baserow to maintain a customer relationship management (CRM) system. When a new lead is captured via a form on your website, Pipedream can trigger a workflow that adds or updates the lead's details in Baserow. Connect it to an email marketing app like Mailchimp to automatically subscribe the new lead to a mailing list.

- **Project Management Sync**: Keep your project management tools in sync with Baserow. When a task is marked as completed in Baserow, trigger a Pipedream workflow to update the task status in another project management app like Trello or Asana, ensuring all team members stay up-to-date with the latest project progress.

- **Survey Response Aggregation**: Collect responses from a survey platform like Typeform and use Pipedream to add each response as a new record in Baserow. This can be further extended to analyze survey data, send personalized follow-up emails through SendGrid, or create detailed reports by connecting to data visualization tools like Google Data Studio.
