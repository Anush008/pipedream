# Overview

Beehiiv is a platform designed for building and managing newsletter businesses. With the Beehiiv API, you can automate various aspects of email marketing on Pipedream's serverless integration and compute platform. Connect with subscribers, manage your content, analyze campaign performance, and scale your newsletter operation by triggering workflows with Beehiiv events or scheduling tasks. Whether you aim to synchronize subscriber lists, streamline content delivery, or analyze engagement data, Pipedream makes it seamless to integrate Beehiiv with other apps to create powerful automation sequences.

# Example Use Cases

- **Subscriber Synchronization Workflow**: Leverage the Beehiiv API to sync subscriber data with a CRM like HubSpot. Every time a new subscriber is added in Beehiiv, automatically add them as a contact in HubSpot, ensuring your CRM contacts are always up-to-date and enabling targeted follow-up campaigns.

- **Automated Content Distribution**: Use the Beehiiv API to automate the distribution of new content. When you publish a new article on your CMS, such as WordPress, trigger a workflow that creates a new email campaign in Beehiiv to share the article with your subscribers, driving engagement and traffic to your site.

- **Performance Analysis and Reporting**: After sending an email campaign, employ the Beehiiv API within Pipedream to fetch campaign performance data and send it to Google Sheets. This allows for streamlined reporting, making it easier to analyze trends, track engagement, and make data-driven decisions to optimize your newsletter strategy.
