# Overview

The BitBucket API taps into the robust functionality of BitBucket's Git and Mercurial code management for teams. On Pipedream, you can use this API to automate workflows, sync data across various platforms, and trigger actions based on events in BitBucket. From committing code to moderating pull requests and issues, it's all programmable. Pair it with other apps available on Pipedream to create powerful integrations.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate Code Deployment**: Trigger a Pipedream workflow when a new commit is pushed to a branch. Automatically deploy the code to a server or a platform like AWS, Google Cloud, or Heroku if certain conditions are met. The BitBucket API in Pipedream can check for commit messages, branch names, or specific files changes before triggering the deployment process.

- **Sync Issues Across Platforms**: Use the BitBucket API to watch for new issues or comments. Then, sync these updates to a project management tool such as Trello or Jira. For example, each new issue in BitBucket could create a Trello card, helping non-technical team members track progress without needing to navigate BitBucket.

- **Pull Request Management**: Set up workflows that run tests on pull requests and send notifications to Slack or Discord with the results. Automate the merge process based on successful checks or approvals. This streamlines code review by providing all necessary info where your team already communicates, cutting down on context switching.
