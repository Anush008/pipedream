# Overview

The BitBucket API unlocks a myriad of possibilities for automating your version control workflows on Pipedream. From triggering actions based on code commits to managing pull requests, the API lets you integrate BitBucket with various other services and tools. By harnessing this power on Pipedream, developers can create custom CI/CD pipelines, automate code review processes, sync issues across platforms, and more, all with real-time execution and without the need for dedicated infrastructure.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Deployment on Push:** Trigger a deployment through Pipedream when new code is pushed to a specified branch. This can be connected to AWS Lambda to update your serverless functions automatically.

- **PR Review Coordinator:** Simplify your code review process by using the BitBucket API on Pipedream to assign reviewers to pull requests, send notifications to Slack, and ensure that all reviews are completed before merging.

- **Issue Sync with JIRA:** Keep your project management in sync with your codebase by automating the creation of JIRA issues when new issues are reported in BitBucket or vice versa. This ensures a seamless workflow between issue tracking and version control.
