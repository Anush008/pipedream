# Overview

The Box API lets you access and manage your Box content, such as files, folders, and collaborations, programmatically. With Pipedream, you can tap into the Box API to create powerful automations, integrations, and workflows that streamline document handling and collaboration processes. You can trigger workflows on file uploads, comments, or when specific changes occur in your Box account, and connect these events to hundreds of other apps supported by Pipedream.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Document Backup**: When a new document is uploaded to a specific Box folder, trigger a Pipedream workflow that automatically backs it up to another storage service like Google Drive, ensuring redundancy for important files.

- **Content Approval Pipeline**: Set up a workflow where files uploaded to a "Pending Approval" folder in Box are automatically sent to Slack or Microsoft Teams for review. Once approved, the file can be moved to an "Approved" folder in Box, and the uploader notified via email.

- **Invoicing and Billing Automation**: Automate the invoicing process by triggering a workflow when an invoice is uploaded to Box. The workflow can extract relevant data using an OCR service, create an invoice record in an accounting app like QuickBooks, and send a payment reminder to the client.
