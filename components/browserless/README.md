# Overview

The Browserless API on Pipedream allows you to automate web interactions without a browser. Harness the power of headless Chrome to perform tasks like web scraping, automated testing, or taking screenshots and PDFs of web pages. By integrating the Browserless API into Pipedream workflows, you unlock a realm of possibilities, enabling serverless, event-driven automations that react to various triggers and interact with numerous other services and APIs.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Screenshot Capture**: Grab a screenshot of a webpage when a specific trigger occurs. For example, when a new product is added to your e-commerce platform, capture a screenshot and store it in Amazon S3 using the AWS app on Pipedream.

- **Web Scraping for Data Collection**: Perform regular web scraping to gather data from various websites. Combine Browserless with the Pipedream's Cron Scheduler to run scraping jobs at set intervals, then process and send the collected data to Google Sheets for analysis and reporting.

- **PDF Generation from HTML**: Convert HTML pages or documents into PDFs on-the-fly. When an invoice is generated in your accounting software, use Browserless to create a PDF and then email it to the customer by integrating with the SendGrid app on Pipedream.
