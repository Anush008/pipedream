# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Meeting Notifications**: When a new meeting is scheduled via Cal.com, trigger a Pipedream workflow to send a custom notification to a Slack channel and create an event in a Google Calendar, ensuring the team stays informed and the event is blocked off across all necessary calendars.

- **Pre-Meeting Questionnaire Dispatch**: Before a meeting, use Pipedream to send a GetResponse email containing a pre-meeting questionnaire to the attendee who booked through Cal.com. Automate the collection of responses in a Google Sheet for easy review and preparation.

- **Post-Meeting Feedback Collection**: After a meeting has concluded, trigger a workflow in Pipedream to send a follow-up email with a feedback form using Mailchimp. Store responses in a database like Airtable to analyze the effectiveness of your meetings and continuously improve the experience.
