# Overview

The Cal.com API offers a powerful interface to automate scheduling and calendar management. With this API, you can create, update, and cancel appointments, list events, and synchronize calendars across different platforms. Integrating Cal.com with Pipedream opens up possibilities for advanced scheduling workflows, data syncing with other apps, and personalization of communication based on calendar events.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate Meeting Confirmations**: Set up a workflow that triggers whenever a new appointment is booked via Cal.com. The Pipedream workflow can automatically send a personalized confirmation email to the participant using the SendGrid app, and post a message to a Slack channel notifying your team about the new appointment.

- **Sync Appointments with CRM**: Whenever an appointment is rescheduled or canceled in Cal.com, trigger a Pipedream workflow that updates the corresponding event in a CRM like Salesforce. This keeps sales or support teams in sync with the latest scheduling changes without manual data entry.

- **Event Reminder System**: Build a workflow that sends SMS reminders through the Twilio app to participants a day before their scheduled appointment. The workflow can pull upcoming events from Cal.com and use logic to only send reminders for events happening within the next 24 hours.
