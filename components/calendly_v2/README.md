# Overview

The Calendly API allows you to build automated workflows that can streamline appointment scheduling processes by interacting with your Calendly account. With Pipedream's capabilities, you can harness this API to trigger actions in other apps when new Calendly events are scheduled, update contacts in a CRM when meetings happen, or even customize follow-up actions based on the specifics of the meeting booked. Pipedream's serverless platform lets you connect Calendly to hundreds of other apps to create bespoke automation workflows without writing extensive code.

# Example Use Cases

- **Sync New Calendly Events to Google Calendar**: When a new event is scheduled in Calendly, automatically create a corresponding event in Google Calendar. This keeps all your appointments in sync and ensures you never miss a meeting.

- **Automated Follow-up Emails via SendGrid**: After a Calendly event concludes, automatically send a personalized follow-up email through SendGrid. You can include details specific to the meeting or next steps, enhancing the attendee's experience and keeping the conversation going.

- **Update Salesforce Leads on Meeting Completion**: Once a meeting with a lead is completed in Calendly, use Pipedream to update the lead's status in Salesforce. This workflow can help sales teams track engagement and move leads through the sales pipeline more effectively.
