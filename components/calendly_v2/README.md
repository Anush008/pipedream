# Overview

The Calendly API unlocks the power to automate scheduling, enabling seamless integration with other tools and workflows. With it, you can sync Calendly events with your calendar, send custom notifications, or trigger actions in other apps post-event creation or cancellation. Use this API on Pipedream to craft workflows that react in real-time to new meetings or updates, manage contacts across platforms, and personalize your scheduling logic without manual intervention.

# Example Use Cases

- **Sync New Calendly Events to Google Sheets**: When a new event is scheduled on Calendly, trigger a workflow that captures the event details and appends them to a Google Sheet. This allows for easy tracking of appointments and attendee information in a centralized location.

- **Automated Follow-up Emails After Calendly Events**: After a Calendly event concludes, trigger an email through SendGrid to the attendee. Customize this email for feedback requests, thank-you notes, or sharing additional resources, improving the post-meeting experience without manual effort.

- **Dynamic Event Creation via Slack Commands**: Use Slack slash commands to create new Calendly events. When a command is issued in Slack, Pipedream triggers a workflow that interacts with the Calendly API to set up the event with predefined settings or custom inputs from the Slack message.
