# Overview

The Chargebee API provides a powerful avenue for automating your subscription billing processes, allowing you to manage subscriptions, invoices, and customers directly through API calls. Using Pipedream, you can create serverless workflows that trigger on various Chargebee events or schedule recurring tasks to streamline your billing operations. Integrate Chargebee with other apps on Pipedream to sync data, send notifications, or manage customer interactions in real-time.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Dunning Email Sequence**: Trigger a workflow in Pipedream when a payment fails in Chargebee. Use this to send a series of dunning emails, escalating the urgency or offering different payment options. Connect with email platforms like SendGrid or Gmail to dispatch these notifications.

- **Sync New Subscribers to CRM**: Every time a new subscription is created in Chargebee, automatically add the subscriber's details to your CRM. Pipedream can facilitate this by integrating Chargebee with CRMs like Salesforce or HubSpot, keeping your sales team in sync with billing activities.

- **Real-time Slack Notifications on Subscription Changes**: Set up a Pipedream workflow to monitor subscription changes in Chargebee, such as upgrades, downgrades, or cancellations. Have these events post a message to a designated Slack channel, ensuring your team stays informed about customer subscription statuses instantly.
