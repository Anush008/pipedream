# Overview

The ChatBot API on Pipedream enables you to tap into the capabilities of conversational bots to perform a range of tasks from customer support to lead generation. By integrating with this API, you can automate conversations, manage chat histories, and trigger actions based on user inputs. Pipedream's serverless platform allows for orchestrating complex workflows that can take responses from the ChatBot API and connect with other services to create dynamic, multi-step automations.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate Customer Support**: Trigger a workflow when a user asks for help within the chatbot. The workflow can look up user details from a CRM like Salesforce, and push relevant information back into the chat conversation to resolve queries without manual intervention.

- **Lead Qualification and Alerting**: When a potential lead interacts with the chatbot, use the ChatBot API to assess the conversation and qualify the lead. If the lead is promising, automatically send an alert via email or Slack to the sales team with the chat transcript and lead details.

- **Event Registration via Chat**: Implement a chatbot workflow that lets users register for events. When a user expresses interest, the ChatBot API can capture the data and feed it into an event management app like Eventbrite, while also sending a confirmation and calendar invite to the user's email address.
