# Overview

The Cisco Webex API provides a vast playground for automating interactions with Webex Teams spaces, managing meetings, and working with the Webex devices. Within Pipedream, you can use this API to create workflows that trigger on specific events in Webex, such as new messages or meeting alerts, and then interact with other services, enabling seamless communication and collaboration enhancements. Think of Pipedream as the glue that connects Webex to a universe of other apps, making it possible to automate complex tasks without writing a single line of code.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Meeting Summaries**: After a Webex meeting ends, trigger a workflow that generates a summary using natural language processing and posts it to a designated team space. This could be paired with an app like Dropbox to save the summaries.

- **Team Notification System**: Set up a workflow that listens for keywords in a Webex space and triggers notifications to a team's Slack channel. This could be used for urgent updates or to keep teams aligned without manual messaging.

- **Helpdesk Ticket Creation**: When a message in a Webex space indicates a technical issue, trigger a workflow that creates a helpdesk ticket in a service like Jira or Zendesk, including the message details and tagging the appropriate support personnel.
