# Overview

The Cisco Webex API allows you to integrate a powerful suite of communication tools into your applications and workflows. On Pipedream, you can harness this API to automate meeting management, messaging, and event-driven actions. By creating workflows that respond to Webex events, send messages, or manage meetings, you can streamline collaboration and productivity without leaving Pipedream's platform.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate Meeting Invitations**: Automatically send Webex meeting invites to participants when a new event is scheduled in a Google Calendar. This workflow can listen for new events in Google Calendar, then use the Webex API to create a meeting and dispatch invitations instantly.

- **Sync Messages to CRM**: Synchronize messages from a Webex space to a CRM platform like Salesforce. Whenever a new message is posted in a designated space, the workflow can capture the content and create a corresponding record in Salesforce, ensuring customer interactions are logged and easily accessible.

- **Event-Driven Notifications**: Send custom notifications to a Slack channel when a Webex meeting starts. This workflow can monitor the Webex API for `meeting.started` events and then post a tailored message to a Slack channel, keeping the team informed about meeting activity in real time.
