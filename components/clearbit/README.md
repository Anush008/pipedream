# Overview

Clearbit API on Pipedream provides access to rich company and contact data, allowing users to enrich leads, automate prospecting, and personalize marketing. You can use it to append information to email addresses, find company data based on domain names, or look up contacts. By integrating Clearbit with Pipedream's serverless platform, you can create workflows that trigger actions in other apps based on the data retrieved, making it immensely powerful for sales and marketing automation.

# Example Use Cases

- **Lead Enrichment on Signup**: Automatically enrich new user signups by capturing their email addresses and using Clearbit to append additional information. Trigger a welcome email using SendGrid with personalized content based on the user's company details.

- **Automated Prospect Research**: When a new company is added to your CRM (like Salesforce), use Clearbit to find additional contacts within that company and add this data back into your CRM, giving your sales team instant insights.

- **Personalized Marketing Campaigns**: Create a workflow that listens for new subscribers on Mailchimp, enriches their profile information via Clearbit, then segments them into different marketing campaigns based on their role or industry for tailored email content.
