# Overview

Clearbit API on Pipedream lets you enrich your CRM with deep customer insights, automate lead scoring, or tailor marketing efforts with real-time data. By integrating Clearbit's intelligence capabilities into Pipedream's serverless platform, you gain the agility to craft workflows that enhance your data strategy, improve personalization, and streamline lead generation processes.

# Example Use Cases

- **Enrich Sign-ups with User Data**: Automate user data enrichment by triggering a workflow whenever a new user signs up in your app. Use the Clearbit Enrichment API to gather detailed info about the user's company and role, then update the user profile in your database with this data.

- **Automated Lead Scoring**: Build a workflow that scores leads instantly based on data from Clearbit. When a new lead is added to your CRM, trigger a workflow that uses Clearbit to fetch their company's size, technology stack, and funding. Combine this with your scoring logic to prioritize high-value leads.

- **Tailored Email Campaigns**: Create more targeted email campaigns by segmenting your audience based on Clearbit data. Set up a workflow that runs daily to segment users in your email marketing platform (like Mailchimp) based on their company's industry, employee count, or other Clearbit attributes.
