# Overview

The ClickSend SMS API on Pipedream allows you to send text messages programmatically, enabling communication with users for alerts, reminders, verification codes, and more. With Pipedream, you can create serverless workflows that trigger SMS sending, process incoming messages, and connect with other apps for a seamless automation experience. You can harness the convenience of Pipedream's event-driven architecture to react to specific activities or schedules, and engage with your audience through SMS without manual intervention.

# Example Workflows

- **Customer Order Alerts**: Send SMS notifications to customers when their orders are processed or shipped. Connect ClickSend SMS to an e-commerce platform like Shopify using Pipedream workflows. When an order status changes in Shopify, it triggers an SMS alert via ClickSend to keep the customer updated in real-time.

- **Appointment Reminders**: Automate the sending of appointment reminders by linking ClickSend SMS with a calendar app like Google Calendar. Set up a workflow on Pipedream that checks for upcoming appointments and sends out a reminder SMS to the relevant individuals a day before their scheduled appointment.

- **Two-Factor Authentication**: Enhance security by integrating ClickSend SMS with your authentication system for two-factor verification. Create a Pipedream workflow that sends a unique code via SMS when a user attempts to log in, and then verifies the code before granting access.
