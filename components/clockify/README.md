# Overview

The Clockify API enables you to seamlessly integrate time tracking capabilities into your workflows on Pipedream. With Clockify's endpoints, you can automate time tracking, reporting, and project management tasks. Create custom workflows to sync time entries, manage projects, and analyze team productivity, all within the Pipedream ecosystem. Harness the power of serverless to connect Clockify with other apps, trigger time tracking with events, and streamline operations without writing a line of backend code.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate Time Entry Based on Calendar Events:** Trigger a workflow that starts a new time entry in Clockify when a Google Calendar event begins and stops it when the event ends, ensuring accurate tracking of meetings and appointments.

- **Sync Project Management:** When a new task is created in Trello, automatically create a corresponding project or task in Clockify and track the time spent on the task as it moves through different stages in the Trello board.

- **Weekly Time Entry Reports:** Generate weekly reports by aggregating time entries from Clockify, format them, and send a summary email to the team or management using a service like SendGrid, keeping everyone informed on project progress and team productivity.
