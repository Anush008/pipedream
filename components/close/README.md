# Example Use Cases

- **Lead Synchronization With Google Sheets**: Automatically sync new leads from Close to a Google Sheet. This workflow can be set up to trigger whenever a new lead is created in Close. The lead details are then appended to the specified Google Sheet, ensuring that you have a backup and an easy way to share lead data with your team.

- **Task Creation for Follow-up Emails**: Each time a sales opportunity moves to a new stage in Close, create a task in a tool like Trello or Asana to remind your team to send a follow-up email. This ensures no lead is left behind and that your team has a clear workflow for nurturing leads through the sales pipeline.

- **Slack Notifications for Closed Deals**: Celebrate wins instantly by sending a custom notification to a Slack channel when a deal is marked as won in Close. This keeps the entire team informed and maintains enthusiasm and motivation by sharing each success story as it happens.
