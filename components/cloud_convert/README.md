# Overview

The Cloud Convert API on Pipedream enables you to automate file conversion processes between more than 200 formats, such as documents, images, audio, video, and more. With Pipedream's serverless platform, you can create workflows that trigger conversions with various events, process files, and integrate the results with other appsâ€”all without managing infrastructure.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Image Format Conversion**: Trigger a workflow whenever a new image is uploaded to your AWS S3 bucket, convert it into different formats using Cloud Convert, and then save the new versions back into S3 or send them to another storage service.

- **Document Conversion for Email Attachments**: Set up a workflow that monitors your Gmail for incoming emails, extracts attachments, converts those documents to a preferred format with Cloud Convert, and then stores them in Google Drive or sends them to a specific recipient.

- **Audio Transcoding for Content Platforms**: Implement a workflow where new audio files uploaded to a service like Dropbox are automatically detected, transcoded into different bitrate formats using Cloud Convert, and then distributed to various audio streaming platforms.
