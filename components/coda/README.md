# Overview

Coda API on Pipedream allows you to automate and integrate your docs with other apps and data sources. Leverage Pipedream's serverless platform to run workflows that interact with Coda tables and rows, pull data, push updates, or trigger actions based on events. With access to Coda's robust API, you can create dynamic docs that serve as powerful tools for project management, data collection, and reporting, all while integrating seamlessly with your tech stack.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Project Updates**: Sync tasks from Coda to a project management tool like Asana. Whenever a task is updated or completed in Coda, the workflow triggers and updates the task in Asana, keeping project statuses in sync.

- **CRM and Sales Reporting**: When a new contact is added to a Coda doc, trigger a workflow that adds the contact to a CRM like Salesforce. Additionally, compile and send a daily sales report from Coda data to a Slack channel to keep the team updated on the latest sales figures.

- **Customer Feedback Aggregation**: Collect customer feedback from various platforms, such as email or social media, using Pipedream's event sources. Process and insert this feedback into a designated Coda table for centralized analysis and response planning.
