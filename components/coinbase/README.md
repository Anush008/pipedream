# Overview

The Coinbase API offers a powerful way to interact with the Coinbase platform, enabling you to automate trading, access real-time or historical cryptocurrency data, and manage accounts. With Pipedream, you can harness this API to create custom, serverless workflows that respond to various triggers, such as scheduled intervals, webhooks, or even actions from other apps. Automate your cryptocurrency tasks, analyze market trends, or get instant alerts based on specific market conditions, all within Pipedream's intuitive platform.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Cryptocurrency Purchase**: Set up a workflow that purchases a predefined amount of a specific cryptocurrency when its price drops below a certain threshold. Combine this with a trigger that checks the current prices at regular intervals.

- **Portfolio Value Alert**: Create a workflow that calculates the total value of your cryptocurrency portfolio at the end of each day and sends a summary report to your email or a messaging app like Slack. This workflow can utilize scheduled triggers and actions that interact with the Coinbase API and your chosen notification service.

- **Exchange Rate Notification**: Configure a Pipedream workflow that monitors currency exchange rates and sends you an SMS via Twilio when a pair like BTC to USD reaches a certain exchange rate, allowing you to make timely trading decisions.
