# Overview

The Coinbase API on Pipedream allows you to automate interactions with your Coinbase account, enabling you to programmatically manage cryptocurrencies. With this API, you can access real-time pricing data, manage buys and sells, and monitor transactions. Pipedream's serverless platform makes it a breeze to create workflows that respond to Coinbase events, schedule regular crypto transactions, or integrate with other services to enhance your crypto operations.

# Example Use Cases
