Using Pipedream, you can harness this data for various applications such as tracking asset prices, alerting on market changes, and integrating cryptocurrency data into other apps or services. With Pipedream's serverless platform, you can set up workflows that respond to HTTP requests, schedule tasks, process data, and connect to over 800+ apps with no infrastructure to maintain.

# Example Use Cases

Extract current news headlines or social media posts related to cryptocurrencies, analyze the sentiment, and combine it with price data to gain insights into market trends and potential investment decisions.
