# Overview

The CoinMarketCap API provides real-time access to cryptocurrency market cap rankings, charts, and more, allowing developers to tap into a wealth of financial data. On Pipedream, this API becomes a powerful tool to automate crypto-related tasks, track portfolio performance, and integrate with other services for alerts, analysis, and more.

# Example Use Cases

- **Portfolio Value Tracker**: Use the CoinMarketCap API to fetch the current prices of your cryptocurrency assets at regular intervals. Store the data in Pipedream's built-in data stores and create a workflow that calculates the total value of your portfolio, alerting you via email or SMS if there are significant changes.

- **Cryptocurrency Alert System**: Set up a workflow that triggers when a cryptocurrency of choice reaches a certain price point or changes by a specific percentage. Integrate with Twilio on Pipedream to send SMS alerts or use Slack to notify a channel when these conditions are met, enabling timely investment decisions.

- **Market Analysis Dashboard**: By connecting CoinMarketCap to Google Sheets via Pipedream, you can continuously import market data to create a live dashboard. This workflow can help you analyze trends, compare cryptocurrencies, and make data-driven investment strategies with the latest market insights.
