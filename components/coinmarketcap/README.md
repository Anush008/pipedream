# Overview

The CoinMarketCap API delivers real-time and historical cryptocurrency market data, including prices, volume, market cap, and more, supporting a plethora of coins and tokens. With Pipedream, you can leverage this data to craft powerful workflows, automate tracking of cryptocurrency metrics, set alerts, and integrate with other services for financial analysis, reporting, or decision-making.

# Example Use Cases

- **Crypto Price Alert System**: Build a workflow that monitors specific cryptocurrencies and sends alerts via email or SMS using Twilio when the price crosses a predefined threshold. This can help you stay informed of market movements without constantly checking the market.

- **Portfolio Valuation Tracker**: Create a daily or hourly scheduled workflow that fetches the current value of your cryptocurrency portfolio and records it in a Google Sheet. This can serve as a personal finance tracker to observe the growth or shrinkage of your assets over time.

- **Social Sentiment Analysis**: Combine the CoinMarketCap API with Twitter's API to trigger a sentiment analysis whenever there's a significant price change in a particular coin. Use this data to gauge market sentiment and potentially predict market trends based on public opinion.
