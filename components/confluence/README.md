# Overview

The Confluence API on Pipedream allows you to automate your Confluence workspace by leveraging its capabilities to create, read, update, and delete content. Through Pipedream's serverless platform, you can harness this API to build custom workflows, connect Confluence with other apps, and orchestrate complex automations with minimal effort. Whether you're managing documents, syncing content across platforms, or automating content updates, the Confluence API provides a powerful way to streamline your team's collaboration and content management processes.

# Example Use Cases

- **Content Sync Between Confluence and Google Drive**: Automatically sync newly created Confluence pages to a designated folder in Google Drive. Whenever a page is added in Confluence, Pipedream triggers a workflow that converts the page to a PDF and uploads it to Google Drive, ensuring your documents are consistently available across both platforms.

- **Daily Content Backup to Dropbox**: Set up a daily workflow to back up select Confluence spaces or pages to Dropbox. Pipedream can schedule a recurring task that fetches content from Confluence and saves it to Dropbox, providing a robust, automated backup solution and peace of mind that your critical data is safe.

- **Slack Notifications for Updated Confluence Pages**: Keep your team informed with instant Slack notifications when a Confluence page is updated. With Pipedream, you can monitor changes in Confluence pages, and when an update is detected, the workflow sends a message with the update summary to a specified Slack channel, ensuring team members always stay in the loop.
