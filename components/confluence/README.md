# Overview

The Confluence API unlocks the ability to programmatically interact with Confluence content and settings. With this API on Pipedream, you can automate document creation and management, harvest insights from page analytics, and streamline collaboration. You can construct workflows that react to events in Confluence or use it as a node in a multi-app automation chain, thereby enhancing productivity and ensuring information consistency.

# Example Use Cases

- **Sync Confluence Updates with Slack**: Automate notifications to a Slack channel when a Confluence page is updated. This keeps your team informed of document changes without manual posting. For example, each time a page is modified in a specified space, a message is sent to a pertinent Slack channel with the update summary.

- **Manage Confluence Content with GitHub**: Developers can tie documentation updates to code changes by triggering Confluence page edits or new page creation whenever a GitHub repo receives a new commit or release. This ensures that your documentation stays in sync with the latest codebase developments.

- **Automate User Onboarding Documents**: When a new employee is added to your HR system, such as BambooHR, automatically generate a set of personalized Conformance pages from templates. This can include their onboarding schedule, policy documents, and personal wikis for project tracking.
