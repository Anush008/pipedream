# Overview

The ConvertKit API empowers you to automate your email marketing by integrating with Pipedream's serverless platform. You can trigger workflows based on subscriber activities, manage contacts, and send targeted emails without manual fuss. With this API on Pipedream, you can build powerful automations that react to subscriber actions in real-time, sync subscriber data across platforms, and personalize your marketing efforts at scale.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate Welcome Email Series**: Trigger a Pipedream workflow whenever a new subscriber joins your ConvertKit list, sending them a personalized welcome email sequence through the API.

- **Sync Subscribers to CRM**: Keep your CRM in sync with ConvertKit by building a workflow that adds or updates subscriber info in your CRM, like Salesforce or HubSpot, whenever there's a new subscriber or an update in ConvertKit.

- **Subscriber Engagement Tracking**: Create a workflow that monitors subscriber engagement using ConvertKit events, such as email opens or link clicks, and logs this data in a Google Sheet for further analysis, allowing for refined segmentation and targeted follow-ups.
