# Overview

The Customer.io API lets you craft targeted, data-driven messages to your users. With Pipedream's integration, you can automate actions based on user behaviors, sync customer data across platforms, and personalize communications at scale. It's a powerful bridge to engage users with timely, relevant content, all triggered by events or orchestrated via Pipedream workflows.

# Example Use Cases

- **Sync New Users to CRM**: Automatically add new sign-ups from your app into Customer.io, then sync them to a CRM like Salesforce. Keep sales in the loop when new users might need a personal touch.

- **Trigger Email Campaigns Based on Product Usage**: Use Customer.io to monitor product interactions. When a user reaches a certain usage threshold, Pipedream can trigger an email sequence in Customer.io encouraging a subscription upgrade or offering support.

- **Automate Support Ticket Creation**: When Customer.io detects a user expressing dissatisfaction in a feedback form, use Pipedream to create a support ticket in a tool like Zendesk, ensuring that your team can respond promptly to address concerns.
