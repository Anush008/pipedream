# Overview

The Datadog API lets you harness the full potential of Datadog directly within Pipedream. With this API, you can automate monitoring, create custom alerts, manage logs, and extend the functionality of your Datadog platform. In Pipedream, trigger workflows on HTTP requests, schedules, or app events, and connect Datadog to other apps seamlessly.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Alerting System**: Create a workflow that triggers from Datadog alerts and automatically posts incident details to a Slack channel, enabling quick team notifications and response.

- **Log Synchronization**: Stream logs from Datadog to AWS S3 buckets using a scheduled Pipedream workflow, ensuring you have backups and enabling advanced analysis with other data services.

- **Performance Metrics Dashboard**: Pull custom metrics from Datadog via their API and send the data to Google Sheets using Pipedream. This can populate a dashboard for non-technical stakeholders to monitor app performance in real-time.
