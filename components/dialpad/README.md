# Overview

The Dialpad API allows you to integrate voice and messaging capabilities into your workflows on Pipedream. With it, you can automate actions like sending messages, managing calls, and controlling user accounts. Pipedream's serverless platform facilitates the creation of complex workflows that respond to events in Dialpad, connect with other apps, and process data in real-time.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Support Ticket Creation:** Trigger a workflow in Pipedream when a new voicemail is received in Dialpad. The audio transcript can be analyzed and a support ticket is automatically created in a tool like Zendesk with relevant details extracted from the call.

- **Call Analytics and Logs Sync:** After a call ends, a Pipedream workflow can be triggered to fetch call details from Dialpad. These details can then be logged into a database or a platform like Google Sheets for tracking and analysis, giving insights into call durations, outcomes, and customer interactions.

- **Real-Time SMS Notifications**: Set up a workflow in Pipedream that listens for incoming SMS messages in Dialpad. Upon receiving a message, the workflow can parse the content and send notifications to a Slack channel, keeping your team immediately informed of urgent messages or customer inquiries.
