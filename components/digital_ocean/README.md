# Overview

The Digital Ocean API taps into the power of cloud infrastructure management, allowing you to programmatically control your Droplets, Spaces, databases, and more. With Pipedream, you can harness this API to automate a myriad of tasks, from server provisioning to scaling operations. Pipedream's serverless platform facilitates the seamless integration of Digital Ocean with other apps, creating custom workflows to streamline your DevOps processes.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Droplet Management:** Use the API to create workflows that trigger Droplet provisioning or teardown based on specific criteria such as server load, time of day, or in response to webhooks from other apps. Pair with monitoring tools like Datadog to scale infrastructure as needed.

- **Database Backup Automation:** Set up a Pipedream workflow that periodically backs up your Digital Ocean databases. It could trigger a backup process on a schedule, upload the backup files to a cloud storage service like Google Drive, and notify you via Slack or email upon completion.

- **CI/CD Pipeline Integration:** Integrate the Digital Ocean API into your CI/CD pipeline for seamless deployment. Use Pipedream to listen for GitHub commits to specific branches, then trigger a workflow that updates your application running on Digital Ocean infrastructure, followed by a suite of automated post-deployment tests.
