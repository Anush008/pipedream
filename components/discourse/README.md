# Overview

The Discourse API lets you automate and extend the capabilities of your Discourse community. With it, you can manage users, posts, topics, and more programmatically. When used with Pipedream, you can create workflows that react to events in Discourse, perform actions based on triggers, and connect with other apps to create rich, automated systems. Whether you want to synchronize user data, auto-moderate content, or analyze community engagement, the Discourse API on Pipedream provides the tools to make it happen efficiently.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate User Onboarding**: When a new user joins your Discourse community, you can use Pipedream to automatically send a welcome email using the Gmail app, enroll them in a campaign in Mailchimp, or add them to a specific group within Discourse for new members.

- **Content Moderation and Alerts**: Monitor new posts for specific keywords and automatically flag them for review or take action, such as hiding the post or notifying moderators via Slack. This can help maintain community standards and respond quickly to inappropriate content.

- **Community Engagement Analysis**: Trigger a workflow on Pipedream when a new topic is created. Use this to feed data into a Google Sheets spreadsheet to track and analyze trends over time, such as the most active times of day or the most popular discussion topics.
