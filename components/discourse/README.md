# Overview

The Discourse API unlocks powerful community interaction capabilities, allowing you to automate, extend, and integrate the forum experience with other services. With Pipedream, you can harness this functionality to create custom workflows. This includes tasks like syncing user data, moderating content, or triggering actions based on forum activities. Pipedream's serverless platform simplifies the process, providing the heavy lifting so you can focus on building efficient automations without managing infrastructure.

# Example Use Cases

- **Sync New Users to CRM**: Automatically add new Discourse users to a CRM like Salesforce. When a user signs up on your Discourse forum, trigger a workflow that captures their details and creates a new contact in Salesforce, keeping your sales team updated with fresh prospects.

- **Content Moderation Alerts**: Use the API to monitor posts for specific keywords and send alerts. Set up a workflow that scans new Discourse posts for certain terms, such as 'urgent support needed', and instantly notify your support team via Slack, ensuring a quick response to high-priority topics.

- **Automated Topic Summaries**: Generate weekly summary emails of top forum content. Create a workflow that compiles the most popular Discourse topics every week and sends out an email digest using a service like SendGrid. This keeps your community engaged by highlighting trending discussions.
