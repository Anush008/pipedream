# Overview

The DocuSign API enables you to automate and integrate your e-signature workflows with Pipedream. With this powerful API, you can send documents for signature, check the status of document workflows, and automate actions based on signature events. This integration allows you to streamline how contracts, agreements, and approvals are handled within your organization, cutting down on manual tasks and speeding up business processes.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate Document Workflow Initiation**: Trigger a workflow on Pipedream when a new entry is added to your CRM, like Salesforce or HubSpot. The workflow could generate and send a customized contract for signature via DocuSign, ensuring a seamless start to your customer onboarding process.

- **Document Status Tracking**: Set up a Pipedream workflow that listens for webhook events from DocuSign, such as 'Envelope Sent' or 'Envelope Completed'. When a document reaches a specific status, automatically update the corresponding record in your project management tool, like Asana or Trello, keeping your team in sync.

- **Post-Signature Process Automation**: After a document is fully signed, use Pipedream to trigger actions such as updating a database record, sending a thank you email through SendGrid or Mailgun, and even initiating a payment process through Stripe if the document involves a transaction.
