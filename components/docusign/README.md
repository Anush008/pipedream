# Overview

The DocuSign API on Pipedream empowers you to automate your e-signature workflows, create and manage agreements, and integrate DocuSign with other services to streamline document handling. By leveraging this API, you can trigger actions based on document status changes, programmatically send documents for signature, and sync data with other business apps, all within Pipedream's serverless platform.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Contract Workflow**: Automatically send out contracts for signature when a deal is marked as won in your CRM. Once signed, update the CRM and notify your team via Slack.

- **New Employee Onboarding**: Streamline the onboarding process by sending necessary employment documents to new hires. When documents are completed, upload them to an HR management system like BambooHR and send a welcome email through Gmail.

- **Document Status Tracking**: Set up a workflow that monitors the status of sent documents. When a document is signed or action is required, log the details in a Google Sheet and send real-time notifications through Microsoft Teams.
