# Overview

The Drip API plugs into Pipedream's strength for seamless integration and automation, allowing you to manage email campaigns, subscribers, and workflows. With Drip, you can automate actions based on user behavior, update subscriber lists, and tailor your marketing efforts with targeted emails. On Pipedream, you can create event-driven workflows that react to data from Drip in real-time or on a schedule, and you can even integrate with other apps to extend your marketing automation capabilities.

# Example Use Cases

- **Subscriber Segmentation Automation**: Automatically segment subscribers in Drip based on their behavior or demographic data gathered from other platforms, such as Shopify or Salesforce. For instance, when a new order is placed in Shopify, a workflow can trigger in Pipedream to tag the customer in Drip for targeted follow-up campaigns.

- **Dynamic Email Campaigns Triggered by User Actions**: Set up workflows that trigger personalized email campaigns in Drip when a user performs a specific action on your app or website. This can include actions like completing a course on a learning platform, which signals Pipedream to tell Drip to send a congratulatory email and suggest additional courses.

- **Lead Scoring Updates in Real-Time**: Create a Pipedream workflow that updates lead scores in Drip based on real-time interactions across different touchpoints. For example, if a user interacts with a campaign on social media, Pipedream could adjust their lead score in Drip, ensuring your sales team focuses on the hottest leads first.
