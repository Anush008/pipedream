# Overview

The Dropbox API on Pipedream allows you to automate file management, collaborate on content, and integrate with other services. You can programmatically upload, download, and share files, as well as manage folders. With Dropbox's extensive functionality available through Pipedream, you can create powerful workflows to streamline your data handling and content management processes.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Backup to Dropbox**: Trigger a workflow that automatically backs up new files from your website to Dropbox whenever they're added to your server. A webhook can notify Pipedream of the new file, which then uses the Dropbox API to upload it, ensuring your files are always backed up.

- **Content Approval Workflow**: Collaborate seamlessly by setting up a Pipedream workflow that listens for new files in a specific Dropbox folder. When a new file is detected, it sends a notification to Slack for review. If approved, Pipedream moves the file to the 'Approved' folder in Dropbox, or it can send an email asking for revisions.

- **Photo Gallery Sync**: Use Pipedream to monitor a Dropbox folder for new photos. When new images are uploaded, Pipedream can resize the images using a service like the ImageMagick API, watermark them, and then sync them to a gallery on your website, keeping your content fresh and updated.
