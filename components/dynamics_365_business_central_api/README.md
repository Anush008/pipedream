# Overview

The Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central API opens the door to automating and integrating a vast array of business processes. It provides endpoints for managing financials, operations, sales, and customer service, allowing you to weave these functions seamlessly into your existing applications and workflows. With Pipedream, you can tap into this power to create tailored, serverless workflows that react in real-time to events in Business Central, automate tasks, sync data across platforms, and much more, with little to no code.

# Example Use Cases

- **Sales Order to Slack Notification**: When a new sales order is created in Dynamics 365 Business Central, trigger a workflow in Pipedream to send a notification with order details to a designated Slack channel. This keeps your team instantly informed about new sales activities.

- **Customer Data Sync to Google Sheets**: Whenever a customer's details are updated in Business Central, use Pipedream to automatically reflect these changes in a Google Sheets spreadsheet. This can be particularly useful for sharing customer information with teams who may not have direct access to the Business Central environment.

- **Invoice Automation with Stripe**: Generate invoices in Dynamics 365 Business Central upon successful payment events from Stripe. Pipedream can listen for Stripe's payment succeeded webhook, then trigger the creation of a corresponding invoice in Business Central, streamlining the payment reconciliation process.
