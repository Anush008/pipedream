# Overview

The ERPNext API enables you to automate and integrate a vast array of business operations covered by ERPNext such as accounting, sales, purchasing, inventory, and project management. By leveraging this API within Pipedream, you can create seamless workflows to sync data across platforms, trigger actions based on business events, and streamline operations by connecting ERPNext with other apps and services.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Invoice Creation and Payment Tracking**: Whenever a new sale is recorded in your e-commerce platform, you can use Pipedream to create a corresponding invoice in ERPNext. Further, monitor the invoice payment status and, once paid, update the order status in your e-commerce platform.

- **Inventory Sync with Suppliers**: Keep your ERPNext inventory levels in sync with your suppliers' stock. When inventory levels fall below a certain threshold in ERPNext, automatically send a purchase request to your supplier and update stock levels upon confirmation.

- **Project Time Tracking and Payroll Processing**: Connect ERPNext with time tracking apps like Toggl. Whenever a time entry is logged for a project in Toggl, Pipedream can create a corresponding time log in ERPNext, and use this data to help process payroll within ERPNext at the end of each pay period.
