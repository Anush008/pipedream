# Overview

The ERPNext API opens up a universe of possibilities for streamlining enterprise resource planning. By integrating with Pipedream, you can automate workflows, sync data across applications, or trigger actions based on events within ERPNext. Whether you're looking to automate invoice generation, manage inventory, or maintain customer relations, the API can help you connect ERPNext to numerous other services and internal systems, making your business processes more efficient.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate Sales Invoice Creation**: Automatically create a sales invoice in ERPNext when a new order is placed in your e-commerce platform, such as Shopify. Once an order is detected in Shopify, Pipedream can trigger a workflow that creates a corresponding invoice in ERPNext, ensuring your accounting records are always up-to-date.

- **Sync Contacts with a CRM**: Maintain seamless sync between ERPNext and your CRM, like HubSpot. When a new contact is added to HubSpot, use Pipedream to create or update the contact information in ERPNext. This can help in keeping a unified customer database across all your business tools.

- **Inventory Level Alerts**: Set up a workflow that monitors your product inventory levels in ERPNext and sends an alert via Slack or email when stock for a particular item falls below a threshold. This ensures that you can reorder or address inventory issues in a timely manner.
