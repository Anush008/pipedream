# Overview

The Etherscan API provides a lens into the Ethereum blockchain, allowing developers to query for transaction data, wallet balances, and contract events, among other things. It's the go-to tool for Ethereum blockchain data, essential for anyone needing up-to-date information on transactions, wallet balances, and smart contract interactions. With Pipedream, you can integrate Etherscan's data into your workflows, creating a seamless bridge between on-chain events and off-chain actions. Whether automating notifications, tracking wallet activity, or analyzing the blockchain, Etherscan on Pipedream facilitates a variety of use cases.

# Example Use Cases

- **Wallet Balance Tracker**: Keep an eye on the balance of specific Ethereum wallets by scheduling a daily check with Pipedream's cron job feature. If there's a significant balance change, use the Twilio app on Pipedream to send an SMS alert, keeping you or your stakeholders informed about critical balance fluctuations.
