# Overview

The Eventbrite API lets you tap into a robust platform for event management and ticketing. Using Pipedream, you can automate workflows that interact with Eventbrite, from synchronizing events to different calendars to sending customized emails when a new attendee registers. With Pipedream's serverless platform, you can create, modify, and leverage Eventbrite's Webhooks without managing infrastructure, using code or no-code options.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Event Promotion**: When you create an event in Eventbrite, use Pipedream to automatically post the event details to social media platforms like Twitter or Facebook to kickstart your promotion efforts.

- **Synchronized Attendee Management**: Integrate Eventbrite with Google Sheets on Pipedream. As new attendees register, add their details to a Google Sheet, enabling easy sharing and manipulation of attendee data for event planning and follow-ups.

- **Post-Event Engagement**: After an event concludes, trigger a Pipedream workflow to send personalized thank you emails to attendees via SendGrid, and encourage them to provide feedback through a connected survey tool like Typeform.
