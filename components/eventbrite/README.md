# Overview

The Eventbrite API on Pipedream enables you to automate event management and attendee engagement. With this API, you can create events, update event details, manage orders, and interact with attendees. It's ideal for streamlining event workflows, integrating with marketing or CRM tools, and personalizing attendee experiences. Use Pipedream to trigger workflows from Eventbrite events, or to make direct API calls to process event data in real-time.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Event Creation**: Create a workflow that listens for new entries in a Google Sheets document and automatically creates an event on Eventbrite. Coupling Google Sheets and Eventbrite streamlines the event setup process and keeps everything centralized.

- **Sync Attendee Data with CRM**: After each new Eventbrite order, trigger a workflow to add or update the attendee's information in a CRM tool like Salesforce. This ensures your sales team has the latest data for follow-up marketing campaigns or personalized outreach.

- **Post-Event Feedback Collection**: Design a workflow that sends out a survey via an email service like SendGrid to all attendees after an event concludes. Gather valuable feedback by automating this process, allowing for timely engagement and insight collection.
