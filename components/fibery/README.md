# Overview

The Fibery API unfolds a world where workspaces are tailored to fit team needs, allowing data linkage, creation, and automation across different types of work items. By leveraging the Fibery API on Pipedream, you can automate workflows, sync data with other services, and create custom integrations that push and pull data from your Fibery account. Build dynamic, real-time applications that respond to events in Fibery, or schedule tasks to keep your team's data in sync across multiple platforms.

# Example Use Cases

- **Sync Fibery Tasks with Google Calendar**: Create a workflow on Pipedream that listens for new tasks or meetings in Fibery and automatically adds them as events in Google Calendar. This keeps your schedules in sync and enables you to manage your time efficiently without manual entry.

- **Automated Feedback Collection**: Set up a Pipedream workflow that triggers when a user submits feedback in your product. Capture that feedback in Fibery as a new entity in a Feedback Type, aggregate it, and send a summary report to a Slack channel on a weekly basis for your team to review.

- **GitHub Commit Linked to Fibery Changes**: Whenever a new commit is pushed to a GitHub repository, use Pipedream to post a message with the commit details to a related Feature or Bug in Fibery. This ensures that your development work is closely connected with your planning and bug tracking in Fibery, maintaining traceability and context for your team.
