# Overview

The Figma API unlocks programmatic access to your design files and components in Figma, enabling you to read design details, update files, and more. Within Pipedream, you can harness this API to automate workflows that streamline the intersection of design and development. For instance, you can auto-generate assets, pull design tokens into a development project, or sync design versions with task management tools.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Design Asset Export**: Trigger a Pipedream workflow to export Figma assets whenever a new design version is published. The exported assets can then be automatically uploaded to a cloud storage service like Google Drive or Dropbox to streamline asset sharing with developers and stakeholders.

- **Syncing Design Updates to Project Management Tools**: Create a workflow on Pipedream that listens for comments or version updates on a Figma file. When detected, the workflow can log this information as tasks or updates in project management tools such as Trello or Asana, ensuring team members stay up to date with the latest design changes.

- **Dynamic Style Guide Generation**: Use Pipedream to fetch design tokens, such as colors and typography, from a Figma file and dynamically update a style guide stored in a GitHub repository. This ensures developers always have access to the most current design specifications directly from their codebase.
