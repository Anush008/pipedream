# Overview

The Fitbit API allows you to tap into the data from Fitbit activity trackers, providing access to a user's daily stats such as steps, distance, calories burned, and sleep patterns. In Pipedream, you can harness this data to create custom workflows that trigger on new data, synchronize health metrics with other services, or generate personalized reports and alerts. By using the Fitbit API on Pipedream, you can create automated processes that react to Fitbit events in real-time, seamlessly integrating Fitbit data into your digital ecosystem.

# Example Use Cases

- **Sync Fitbit Data to Google Sheets**: Automatically log daily activity metrics from Fitbit to a Google Sheets spreadsheet. Use this workflow to track progress over time, share fitness goals with a coach, or gather data for a health study.

- **Fitness Milestone Notifications**: Set up a workflow that sends a congratulatory email or SMS when you reach a personal best, such as a step goal or longest run, using Fitbit data. Connect with email services like SendGrid or SMS services like Twilio to deliver the message.

- **Integrate Fitbit with Health Apps**: Share your Fitbit activity data with other health and wellness apps like MyFitnessPal. Whenever Fitbit records a completed workout, use this workflow to log the session in MyFitnessPal to keep all your health information centralized.
