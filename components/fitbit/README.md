# Overview

The Fitbit API on Pipedream allows you to tap into the extensive data from Fitbit devices and user accounts, enabling you to automate fitness and health tracking. With the Fitbit API, you can read a user's activity, sleep patterns, heart rate data, and more. This data can be used to create custom reports, trigger notifications based on activity goals, or integrate with other health and wellness applications to provide a comprehensive view of an individual's health status.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate Daily Activity Reports**: Generate automated reports of your daily steps, distance, and calories burned. These can be sent to your email or stored in a spreadsheet for tracking progress over time.

- **Sleep Quality Monitoring**: Trigger an analysis of your sleep quality after your Fitbit device syncs each morning. Results can be logged to a database or combined with other wellness data to provide recommendations for improving sleep.

- **Heart Rate Alerts**: Set up a real-time alert system that notifies you when your heart rate goes above or below customized thresholds during specific times of the day, which can be critical for monitoring health conditions.
