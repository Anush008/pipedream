# Overview

The Formstack API on Pipedream allows for seamless integration and automation of your Formstack forms and submissions. You can trigger workflows on new submissions, manipulate form data, and connect to countless other services. Whether you're aiming to enhance your CRM with real-time data, generate custom reports, or streamline event registrations, the Formstack API in Pipedream equips you with the tools to automate these tasks efficiently.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate Lead Capture to CRM**: When a new form submission comes in, use Pipedream to parse the submission data and add a new lead to your CRM, such as Salesforce or HubSpot. This way, your sales team always has the latest lead information at their fingertips without manual data entry.

- **Dynamic Email Campaigns Based on Form Inputs**: Design a workflow where Formstack submissions with specific responses automatically enroll users into tailored email sequences in Mailchimp. For example, if a user expresses interest in a particular service, they could receive an email sequence relevant to that service.

- **Event Registration and Calendar Syncing**: Upon receiving a new event registration via a Formstack form, use Pipedream to add the event to company and participant calendars. Integrate with Google Calendar to send out invites and reminders, ensuring no one misses out due to scheduling oversights.
