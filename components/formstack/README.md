# Overview

The Formstack API on Pipedream allows you to automate interactions with your Formstack forms and submissions. It provides a way to integrate your forms with other services, fetch data, and trigger workflows based on form submissions. With Pipedream's serverless platform, you can create workflows that react to Formstack events, analyze and route your form data, and interact with a vast array of APIs to extend the capabilities of your forms.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Data Backup**: When a new form submission is received, trigger a Pipedream workflow to save the submission data to Google Sheets. This ensures that you have a backup and can analyze or report on form submission data within a spreadsheet.

- **Dynamic Response Emails**: Use the Formstack API to send customized email responses via SendGrid when a form is submitted. Based on the submission data, craft personalized content for each respondent, such as sending a discount code to customers who have indicated interest in a specific product on your form.

- **CRM Integration**: On new submissions, trigger a workflow that creates or updates contacts in Salesforce with the submitted data. This allows you to keep your CRM updated in real-time with new lead information or customer feedback captured through Formstack forms.
