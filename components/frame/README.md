# Overview

The Frame.io API opens up a world of possibilities for video collaboration and management within Pipedream. By integrating with this API, you can automate workflows involving video review, sharing, and approval. Whether you're streamlining communications or syncing assets across platforms, the API allows you to leverage Frame.io's powerful features programmatically. Use it to trigger actions when new comments are made, automate the upload of new assets, or synchronize project status with other tools.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Project Syncing**: Sync Frame.io projects with other project management tools like Trello or Asana. Every time a new video is uploaded or a project is updated in Frame.io, the API can trigger a workflow in Pipedream to create a corresponding card or task in your project management tool, keeping your team aligned across platforms.

- **Real-time Comment Alerts**: Stay on top of video feedback by setting up real-time notifications. When someone leaves a comment on a video in Frame.io, use the API to trigger a workflow in Pipedream that sends an immediate alert to Slack, ensuring that the right people get the message quickly and can act on the feedback.

- **Automatic Video Backups**: Ensure that your video assets are always backed up by creating a workflow that uploads new Frame.io assets to cloud storage services like Google Drive or Dropbox. When a new video is added to a Frame.io project, the API can trigger a Pipedream workflow to automatically copy it to your backup location, giving you peace of mind and redundancy.
