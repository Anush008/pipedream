# Overview

The Freshdesk API empowers you to automate and integrate your customer support operations with Pipedream. This API lets you manage tickets, contacts, agents, and more, directly within the Pipedream platform. By crafting serverless workflows on Pipedream, you can connect Freshdesk with other apps, sync data, and trigger actions based on events, leading to streamlined support processes.

# Example Use Cases

- **Ticket Management Automation**: Automate the handling of new Freshdesk tickets by creating a workflow on Pipedream that assigns tickets based on specific keywords or customer data. For example, whenever a new ticket arrives, the API can classify and route it to the right agent or team, or even auto-respond with relevant help articles.

- **Customer Support Enhancement**: Improve your customer support by integrating Freshdesk with Slack using Pipedream. Set up a workflow where high-priority tickets create instant notifications in a dedicated Slack channel, gathering immediate attention from your support team, and ensuring urgent issues are dealt with swiftly.

- **Feedback Collection and Analysis**: Leverage the Freshdesk API to collect customer feedback after ticket resolution. Build a workflow on Pipedream that sends a follow-up survey via email once a ticket is closed. Then, collect and analyze these responses, connecting the data with a tool like Google Sheets to spot trends and areas for improvement.
