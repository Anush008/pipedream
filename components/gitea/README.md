# Overview

The Gitea API is a powerful interface that allows developers to automate and extend their version control workflows within Gitea, a self-hosted Git service. Through Pipedream, you can leverage this API to create custom automation and integration flows, triggering on events from Gitea or pinging Gitea to perform actions. By connecting Gitea with Pipedream, you gain the ability to orchestrate workflows that can manage issues, pull requests, repositories, and more, all within a serverless environment that scales effortlessly with your needs.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate Issue Labeling**: When a new issue is created in Gitea, use Pipedream to analyze the issue's content and automatically apply relevant labels based on keywords, ensuring a smoother triage process.

- **Sync Pull Requests with Trello**: On the creation or updating of a pull request in Gitea, trigger a Pipedream workflow that creates or updates a corresponding Trello card, keeping your project management in sync with code changes.

- **Repository Backup on Release**: Configure a workflow that triggers whenever a new release is published in Gitea. The workflow can archive the repository and upload it to cloud storage like Google Drive, providing an additional layer of backup for your code.
