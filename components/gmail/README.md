# Overview

The Gmail API provides a versatile set of endpoints for interacting with Gmail accounts, enabling the automation of email management tasks such as sending emails, reading incoming messages, and modifying labels. With its functionality exposed via Pipedream's serverless platform, you can craft workflows that react to new messages, programmatically send emails based on triggers from other apps, and organize your inbox without writing a single line of server-side code. Pipedream turns these capabilities into an automation powerhouse, easily connecting Gmail with hundreds of other services.

# Example Use Cases

- **Email Digest Creation**: Aggregate emails received over a certain period, label them, and send a consolidated digest to a specified address. Useful for summarizing important notifications or project updates.
- **Customer Support Ticketing**: On receiving an email with a specific subject line or from a certain domain, create a ticket in a customer support platform like Zendesk. This bridges email communication directly into your support workflow.
- **Email-to-Slack Notifications**: Forward specific emails or email categories from Gmail to a designated Slack channel. Ideal for team alerts, such as when an important client sends a message or when there's an email marked as 'urgent'.
