# Overview

The HighLevel API offers the power to automate and streamline your sales and marketing processes. It's designed to manage contacts, appointments, campaigns, and more. Using Pipedream, you can trigger workflows based on events in HighLevel, manipulate data, sync it with other services, and automate actions that keep your business responsive and efficient.

# Example Use Cases

- **Sync New Leads to a Google Sheet**: Whenever a new lead is captured in HighLevel, Pipedream can automatically add the leadâ€™s details to a Google Sheet. This helps in maintaining an up-to-date list for analysis without manual data entry.
- **Automate Task Creation on Project Management Tools**: Create tasks in project management tools like Trello or Asana when a new appointment is scheduled in HighLevel. This ensures that each new appointment is followed up on time.
- **Send Custom Email Notifications**: Use Pipedream to send custom email notifications using SendGrid or another email service when a specific trigger occurs in HighLevel, such as a deal stage change or a new campaign launch. This keeps your team informed in real-time.
