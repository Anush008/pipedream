# Overview

The Google Analytics API allows you to tap into the power of analytics for your website or app by providing access to data on user interactions. On Pipedream, you can automate processes and integrate this data with other services. Fetch metrics, create custom dashboards, export data for deep analysis, or trigger events based on specific analytics outcomes. With the API, you can monitor real-time activity, pull historical data, or update configuration settings within your Google Analytics account.

# Example Use Cases

- **Real-Time Alerting**: Set up a workflow that monitors your website traffic in real-time. If the number of active users exceeds a certain threshold, trigger an alert. This could send a notification via email or messaging platforms like Slack.

- **Automated Reporting**: Create a recurring workflow that pulls custom reports from Google Analytics and formats the data into a report. Send this report through email, or save it to Google Sheets for easy access and sharing across your organization.

- **A/B Test Monitoring**: If you're running A/B tests on your site, use Pipedream to automate the collection of performance data from Google Analytics. Use this data to update a dashboard in Google Data Studio or another visualization tool to monitor test results and make data-driven decisions.
