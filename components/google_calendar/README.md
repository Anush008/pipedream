# Overview

The Google Calendar API on Pipedream allows you to tap into the rich functionality of Google Calendar to create, read, update, and delete events, calendars, and more. Utilize Pipedream's serverless platform to automate event management based on triggers from other apps, sync calendars across platforms, send reminders or custom notifications, and integrate with countless services without managing servers.

# Example Use Cases

- **Event Reminder System**: Build a system that sends a custom notification (via SMS or email) before an event starts. Use the Google Calendar API to fetch upcoming events and couple it with the Twilio or SendGrid app on Pipedream to notify participants.

- **Meeting Room Booking Sync**: Automate the synchronization of booking schedules between Google Calendar and an external resource management system. Each time a new meeting is scheduled on Google Calendar, Pipedream can update the availability status in the external system to reflect the booking.

- **Workflow Automation for Task Management**: Integrate Google Calendar events with a task management app like Trello or Asana. Whenever a new event is created in Google Calendar, a corresponding task can be created in the task management app with due dates and details, keeping project timelines aligned with scheduled events.
