# Overview

Unlock the power of your schedule with the Google Calendar API on Pipedream. This API lets you create, view, and modify calendar events, manage reminders, and keep tabs on busy schedules right within your workflows. Integrate with other services to automate meeting management, sync with external systems, and build customized scheduling tools.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate Event Creation for New Database Records**: Whenever a new entry is added to your database (such as Airtable or Google Sheets), trigger a workflow that automatically creates a corresponding event in Google Calendar. Keep your calendar in sync with your database entries without lifting a finger.

- **Sync Event Attendees with Email Marketing Lists**: After an event is added to Google Calendar, use Pipedream to sync attendee information to an email marketing platform like Mailchimp. Automatically subscribe attendees to your newsletter or event follow-up sequences, enriching your marketing efforts.

- **Daily Agenda Digest via Slack**: Start each day informed. Schedule a Pipedream workflow to retrieve your Google Calendar events every morning and send a digest to your Slack channel. Stay on top of your schedule by bringing your calendar to where your conversations happen.
