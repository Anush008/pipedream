# Overview

The Google Calendar API lets you interact with your Google Calendar programmatically from Pipedream. You can create, access, and modify calendar events, send invites, and manage reminders. This API is a powerful tool for automating calendar management, integrating with other services to keep your schedule in sync with your apps, and designing complex workflows around your personal or team's time management.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate Event Creation from Emails**: When you receive an email with a specific keyword or from a particular sender, use Pipedream to parse the email and automatically create a calendar event in Google Calendar. This is especially handy for appointment bookings or meeting requests.

- **Sync Tasks from Project Management Tools**: If you use project management tools like Trello or Asana, you can set up a Pipedream workflow to create Google Calendar events for new tasks or deadlines. This ensures that you never miss a milestone and can plan your work schedule efficiently.

- **Send Daily Agenda to Slack**: Start your day informed with a Pipedream workflow that retrieves your daily agenda from Google Calendar and posts it to Slack. You can have a summary of the day's events sent to you or your team's channel every morning, keeping everyone in the loop.
