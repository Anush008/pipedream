# Overview

The Google Calendar API on Pipedream allows you to seamlessly integrate your calendar events with other services for a variety of automations and workflows. Create events, fetch your upcoming schedule, or sync calendars across platforms â€“ all with real-time triggers and without writing a single line of server-side code. Power-up your time management and event coordination by automating reminders, meeting preparation tasks, or syncing with project management tools.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Event Reminders via SMS**: Use the Google Calendar API to watch for upcoming events, and set SMS reminders through the Twilio app. When an event is approaching, Pipedream can trigger a workflow that sends a text message reminder with the event details.

- **Sync Google Calendar with Trello**: Automatically create Trello cards for new Google Calendar events. Whenever you add an event to your Google Calendar, Pipedream can create a corresponding Trello card with the event name, time, and details, ensuring your project management stays up to date with your schedule.

- **Daily Agenda Email Digest**: Compile a daily summary of your Google Calendar events and send it via email each morning. Pipedream can list today's events and use an email service like SendGrid to dispatch a well-formatted digest, so you start your day fully informed about your schedule.
