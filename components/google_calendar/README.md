# Overview

With the Google Calendar API on Pipedream, you can automate your scheduling, integrate your calendar events with other services, and streamline notifications. The API lets you create, modify, or delete events, retrieve calendars, and sync schedules across platforms. Imagine syncing your Google Calendar events with a CRM to track client meetings, or automating reminders for upcoming events through your preferred communication channel. This isn't just about convenience; it's about crafting cohesive systems that keep you punctual and prepared without manual overhead.

# Example Use Cases

- **Event Reminder System**: Automate the process of sending reminders for upcoming calendar events. Use Google Calendar API to fetch events for the next day and set up a workflow in Pipedream that sends customized reminder emails via SendGrid or notifications through Slack to the participants an hour before the event starts.

- **Meeting Scheduler with Zoom**: Build an automation that triggers when a new event is created in Google Calendar. This workflow checks if the event is tagged as a "meeting" and then uses the Zoom API on Pipedream to automatically create a Zoom meeting link, updating the Google Calendar event with the meeting details for seamless virtual meeting organization.

- **Task Synchronization with Trello**: Sync your Google Calendar events with a Trello board to manage tasks more efficiently. When a new event is added to a specific Google Calendar, a Pipedream workflow creates a corresponding card in Trello, including the event details. Conversely, when a due date is added or changed on a Trello card, the workflow updates or creates an event in Google Calendar to reflect this change.
