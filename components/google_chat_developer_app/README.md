# Overview

The Google Chat (Developer App) API enables you to create rich, interactive messages in Google Chat and automate various tasks within the chat environment. Through Pipedream, you can trigger workflows based on new messages or events in Google Chat, send messages, create spaces, and manage memberships. This opens up opportunities for creating bots that can handle tasks such as coordinating calendars, managing task assignments, or even conducting surveys directly within Google Chat.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Helpdesk Bot**: Create a bot within Google Chat that listens for keywords related to IT support and automatically responds with troubleshooting advice or escalates the issue by creating a ticket in a service like Zendesk or Jira.

- **Project Management Notifications**: Set up a workflow that monitors project management tools such as Asana or Trello for updates, and then posts these updates to a dedicated Google Chat space, ensuring your team stays informed about project progress in real-time.

- **Meeting Coordinator**: Develop a bot that helps schedule meetings by integrating with Google Calendar. When a meeting request is mentioned in a chat, the bot can check participants' availability, propose times, and send calendar invites, streamlining the scheduling process.
