# Overview

The Google Classroom API lets educators and learners interact with their Classroom data programmatically. With it, you can automate course creation, manage student enrollments, streamline the assignment process, and extract reports and insights, all within Pipedream's serverless platform. Pairing Google Classroom with Pipedream enables you to create custom workflows, connect with multiple apps, and make the most of Classroom's capabilities without manual intervention.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate Course Creation**: Trigger a workflow when a new term in your school's calendar starts to create a batch of courses on Google Classroom. Set up course names, descriptions, and enrollments automatically.

- **Sync Grades to a Spreadsheet**: After an assignment's due date passes, fetch grades from Google Classroom and push them to a Google Sheets spreadsheet. Share real-time progress with other educators, students, or parents by keeping a centralized grading sheet.

- **Student Enrollment Notifications**: When a student joins or leaves a course, use this event to trigger a workflow that sends a notification to Slack. Keep track of class sizes and changes without manually checking Classroom.
