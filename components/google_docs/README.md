# Overview

The Google Docs API lets you automate and manipulate text documents. With Pipedream, you can craft workflows that read from, write to, and manage your documents programmatically. From generating reports to updating shared documents in real time, Pipedream's serverless platform streamlines these tasks with event-driven automations. The API enables you to create new docs, read and modify existing content, and implement permission controls, all within custom workflows that can integrate with countless other apps and services.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Reporting**: Generate a weekly sales report in Google Docs by pulling data from a CRM like Salesforce. Once the report is compiled, use the Google Docs API to format the text and share it with stakeholders.

- **Content Management**: Watch a GitHub repository for new releases. When a new version is detected, use the Google Docs API to update the relevant documentation with details on the latest features and fixes.

- **Team Updates**: Collect updates from various team tools like Trello or Asana. Then, compile and format these into a digest in a Google Doc. Schedule this workflow to run every Monday morning to keep the team in sync with project statuses.
