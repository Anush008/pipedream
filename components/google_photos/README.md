# Overview

With the Google Photos API on Pipedream, you can automate your photo and album management. This API lets you list photos, upload new ones, and create albums. You could also access media metadata, search through your photos, and share albums or individual photos.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automatically Back Up Photos to Cloud Storage**: Use the Google Photos API to fetch new photos and then save them to a cloud storage service like Dropbox or Google Drive in Pipedream, creating a redundant backup for your pictures.

- **Create a Photo Gallery Website**: Trigger a Pipedream workflow with a new photo upload to Google Photos. Then, use the API to fetch the photo's public link and update your personal or business website gallery, hosted on platforms like WordPress or Squarespace.

- **Social Media Photo Sharing**: Combine Google Photos with the Twitter API to share a daily photo. Every day, Pipedream can pick a random photo from a specified Google Photos album and post it to your Twitter feed, engaging your followers with visual content.
