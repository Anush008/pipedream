# Overview

The Google Sheets API provides a powerful way to interact with Google Sheets, allowing you to read, create, and update spreadsheets programmatically. With Pipedream, you can harness this API to craft custom serverless workflows that automate spreadsheet tasks. These can range from simple data logging to complex data transformations and syncing across various apps. By combining Google Sheets with other Pipedream-supported apps, you create a hub of data that can be updated and monitored in real-time.

# Example Use Cases

- **Sales Pipeline Tracking**: Sync your CRM tool, like Salesforce, with Google Sheets to automatically update a sales pipeline. Whenever a new lead is added in Salesforce, a Pipedream workflow triggers an append action in a designated Google Sheet, keeping a real-time record without manual entry.

- **Inventory Management**: Connect Google Sheets to an e-commerce platform like Shopify. Track inventory changes by updating quantities in a sheet when a new sale occurs. This Pipedream workflow can help ensure stock levels are always accurate, alerting you when it's time to reorder.

- **Social Media Analytics**: Compile social media metrics by connecting platforms such as Twitter or Facebook to Google Sheets. Use Pipedream to fetch data like engagement rates and follower counts, then log them into a spreadsheet for trend analysis and reporting.
