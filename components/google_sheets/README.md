# Overview

The Google Sheets API lets you read, write, and format data in Sheets programmatically. With Pipedream, you can integrate this API to automate spreadsheet-related tasks, sync data between different sources, and manipulate Sheets based on triggers from a multitude of apps. Pipedream's serverless execution environment provides a robust platform to create complex workflows involving Google Sheets without managing infrastructure.

# Example Use Cases

- **Database to Google Sheets**: Sync new records from a database like PostgreSQL to a Google Sheet. Each time a new record is added to the database, a workflow is triggered that appends the data to the specified Sheet, keeping your records in sync.
- **Email Alerts from Google Sheets**: Monitor changes in a Google Sheet and send email notifications through an app like SendGrid whenever specific cells are updated. This is useful for tracking critical metrics or project updates.
- **Form Responses to Google Sheets**: Collect data from a form submitted on platforms like Typeform, and automatically insert the responses into a Google Sheet. Use this workflow to aggregate survey results, sign-ups, or feedback without manual data entry.
