# Overview

The Google Sheets API on Pipedream allows for robust interaction with Google Sheets for reading, writing, and managing spreadsheets programmatically. Leverage this API to automate manual data entry, sync data between different systems, and generate reports. With Pipedream's serverless platform, you can create workflows that trigger on various events, process data as needed, and output to Google Sheets or other services with minimal setup and maintenance.

# Example Use Cases

- **CRM Lead Tracking**: Automatically insert new leads from a CRM like Salesforce into a Google Sheet. Use this workflow to track leads in real time, ensuring sales teams have instant access to the latest prospects without manual data entry.

- **Survey Data Aggregation**: Collect survey responses from Typeform and append them to a Google Sheet. This can be used for real-time analysis and visualization, making it easier to spot trends and gather actionable insights from participant feedback.

- **Inventory Management**: Update Google Sheets with inventory levels from an e-commerce platform like Shopify. Set up notifications to restock items when inventory falls below a certain threshold, keeping stock levels optimal without manual oversight.
