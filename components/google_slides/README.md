# Overview

The Google Slides API lets you read, write, and format Google Slides presentations programmatically. With Pipedream, you can integrate the Google Slides API into serverless workflows to automate presentation generation, data synchronization, and slide customization. Connect with other services, manipulate slides, and orchestrate complex tasks with ease.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Report Generation**: Generate a monthly report by pulling data from a Google Sheet and updating charts and text in a Google Slides template. Once updated, email the presentation to stakeholders.

- **Slide Content Sync**: Keep a Google Slides presentation up-to-date by syncing with the latest content from a CMS or database. Whenever the source data changes, the slides are automatically updated to reflect the new information.

- **Meeting Slide Preparation**: Prepare custom slides for different meetings by integrating calendar data. Prior to each meeting, Pipedream triggers a workflow that populates a Google Slides template with the meeting agenda, attendee names, and other relevant details.
