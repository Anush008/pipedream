# Overview

The Google Slides API lets you create, read, and edit Google Slides presentations programmatically. Within Pipedream's serverless environment, you can harness this API to automate slide creation, update presentations in real-time, extract data, and integrate with countless other services. Pipedream workflows provide a low-code platform to connect Google Slides with various apps to streamline tasks, such as syncing data between slides and a database or triggering slide updates from webhooks.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Report Generation**: Combine Google Slides with Google Sheets on Pipedream to fetch the latest sales data and auto-populate a slide deck for weekly sales reports. Trigger this workflow on a schedule for hands-off reporting.

- **Feedback Collection Slide Update**: Link Google Forms to Google Slides through Pipedream. Each time a form response is submitted, the workflow can update a presentation slide with the new feedback, keeping the team updated in real-time.

- **Event-driven Content Sync**: Use Pipedream to trigger Google Slides updates based on events from a CMS like WordPress. When a new blog post is published, excerpts can be automatically added to a corresponding slide deck for social media or educational presentations.
