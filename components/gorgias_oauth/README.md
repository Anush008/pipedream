# Overview

The Gorgias API provides programmatic access to customer support functionality, allowing you to automate ticket management, update customer profiles, and sync with your knowledge base. With Pipedream, you can seamlessly integrate Gorgias into your customer support workflow, trigger actions based on customer interactions, and connect Gorgias with other services to create a multitiered support system.

# Example Use Cases

- **Auto-Tag Tickets for Prioritization**: Use the Gorgias API on Pipedream to automatically tag incoming support tickets based on keywords or customer data. This workflow helps the support team prioritize and categorize issues faster.

- **Sync Customer Data with CRM**: Keep customer profiles in sync by connecting Gorgias with a CRM like Salesforce. When a new ticket is created or updated in Gorgias, Pipedream can trigger a workflow that updates the customerâ€™s record in Salesforce with the latest interaction data.

- **Automate Common Responses**: Cut response times by using Pipedream to detect common queries in Gorgias and automatically respond with pre-defined answers or add replies to a ticket using standard templates.
