# Overview

The Harvest API allows you to seamlessly integrate time tracking and invoicing features into your apps or workflows. With Pipedream, you can leverage this API to automate your timesheet management, project budget tracking, and invoicing processes. Pipedream's serverless platform enables you to connect Harvest with hundreds of other apps, triggering workflows on events like new time entries or invoices, and even synchronizing data across your tech stack.

# Example Use Cases

- **Sync Time Entries with Google Sheets**: Automatically push new time entries from Harvest to a Google Sheets spreadsheet. This workflow is ideal for creating backup logs, generating custom reports, or allowing team members to view time entries without direct access to Harvest.

- **Project Budget Monitoring**: Set up alerts in Slack or email when project hours reach a certain threshold. By connecting Harvest to notification services, you can keep your team informed and proactively manage project budgets to avoid overruns.

- **Invoice Creation and Payment Tracking**: Generate invoices in Harvest based on project completion or time intervals, then track payments by updating a CRM like Salesforce. This workflow ensures that client data stays in sync and your sales team is up to date on account statuses.
