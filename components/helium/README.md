# Overview

The Helium (Console) API lets you interact with the Helium network, a decentralized system for IoT devices. Using this API, you can manage devices, retrieve data from sensors, and orchestrate the flow of information within the network - All right from Pipedream. With Pipedream's ability to connect to hundreds of other services, you can automate actions based on the data you receive, trigger alerts, and feed data into analytics platforms for deeper insights.

# Example Use Cases

**Automate Data Collection and Analysis**
Retrieve data from your IoT devices on the Helium network and automatically feed it into Google Sheets or a database like PostgreSQL for storage and analysis. Perform real-time monitoring by setting up a workflow that alerts you when data points exceed certain thresholds.

**Smart Alerts System**
Create a workflow that listens for specific events from your IoT devices via Helium (Console) API and sends out alerts via Twilio (SMS), SendGrid (email), or even Slack, ensuring the right people are notified instantly for rapid response.

**Maintenance and Monitoring Automation**
Set up a monitoring system that regularly checks the status and health of your IoT devices. Use the Helium (Console) API to flag devices that are underperforming or offline and automatically create maintenance tickets in a service desk platform like Zendesk or JIRA.
