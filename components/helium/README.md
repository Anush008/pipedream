# Overview

The Helium Console API provides a way to interact with the Helium network, a decentralized, peer-to-peer wireless network designed for Internet of Things (IoT) devices. With this API, you can fetch device data, manage hotspots, and construct workflows around IoT applications on Pipedream. Pipedream's serverless platform allows you to create complex automations with Helium by triggering workflows with incoming data, manipulating that data, and linking it to countless other services, such as cloud storage, databases, or notification systems.

# Example Use Cases

- **Device Data Logging Workflow**: Capture telemetry from your IoT devices and log it to a Google Sheets spreadsheet. As data flows into Helium Console, trigger a Pipedream workflow that processes and formats the data, then appends it to a Google Sheets document for easy visualization and analysis.

- **Alerts for Unusual Device Activity**: Monitor your IoT devices for irregular behavior or readings. Set up a Pipedream workflow that listens for data from the Helium Console API. If a device reports values outside of predefined thresholds, the workflow can send an alert via Slack, SMS, or email to notify you immediately of potential issues.

- **Synchronize Device Data with AWS**: Seamlessly sync device states and event logs from the Helium network to an AWS DynamoDB table. Each time a device updates its status, a Pipedream workflow gets triggered, processes the incoming data, and updates the corresponding entry in DynamoDB, ensuring your AWS-based applications have the latest information.
