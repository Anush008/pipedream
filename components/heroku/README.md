# Overview

The Heroku API integrates with Pipedream to empower developers to automate and enhance their cloud infrastructure management. Via Pipedream, you can programmatically control Heroku apps, manage dynos, add-ons, and configurations, and react to platform events. This enables you to construct workflows that can streamline deployment processes, monitor app performance, or trigger actions based on application events, all within the Pipedream environment.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Deployment on GitHub Push**: Automatically deploy the latest code to Heroku when a new commit is pushed to a specific branch on GitHub. This workflow can help maintain up-to-date staging or production environments with the latest codebase.

- **Dyno Health Check and Auto Restart**: Set up a scheduled workflow that checks the health of Heroku dynos and restarts them if they're not performing optimally. This can ensure higher availability and performance of your applications with minimal manual intervention.

- **Sync Heroku Data to Google Sheets for Reporting**: Extract application metrics and add-on data from Heroku and append them to a Google Sheets spreadsheet at regular intervals. This can be used for creating a custom dashboard to monitor the health and usage statistics of your Heroku apps.
