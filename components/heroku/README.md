# Overview

The Heroku API lets you manage your Heroku apps, dynos, add-ons, and more programmatically. With Pipedream, you can craft workflows that leverage this API to automate app management tasks, such as deploying code, scaling apps, or reacting to system events. Tap into the power of Pipedream's serverless platform to connect Heroku with hundreds of other services, or schedule maintenance tasks to run when you need them.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Deployment Pipeline**: Trigger a deployment to Heroku from GitHub commits. Use the GitHub trigger to start a workflow whenever you push code, then deploy the latest version to your Heroku app using the Heroku API.

- **App Performance Monitoring**: Schedule a Pipedream workflow to regularly check the performance metrics of your Heroku apps. If performance dips below a certain threshold, automatically scale your dynos, or send an alert via Slack or email.

- **Database Backup Routine**: Integrate Heroku with AWS S3 using Pipedream's AWS S3 app. Automatically create and upload backups of your Heroku Postgres database to an S3 bucket on a regular interval for safekeeping.
