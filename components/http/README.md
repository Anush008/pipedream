# Overview

The HTTP / Webhook API on Pipedream is a powerhouse for building custom event-driven workflows. By exposing a unique URL to receive HTTP requests, this API acts as a trigger that kicks off workflows on Pipedream's serverless platform. You can capture data sent to the endpoint, perform manipulations, enact logic, and connect to a multitude of other services to automate tasks. Whether you're syncing data across apps, processing webhooks in real-time, or triggering complex sequences of operations, the HTTP / Webhook API is your gateway to creating scalable and robust automations.

# Example Use Cases

- **Instant Slack Notifications for E-Commerce Orders**: Capture new order notifications from an e-commerce platform using webhooks. Process the order data in Pipedream and automatically send a formatted message to a Slack channel, informing the team about the order details and customer information for swift processing.

- **Automated Content Syndication**: Whenever a new blog post is published, use a webhook to trigger a Pipedream workflow. The workflow can then call APIs of various social media platforms like Twitter, LinkedIn, and Facebook to post updates or summaries linking back to the new content, expanding its reach with zero manual effort.

- **Dynamic Surveys with Google Sheets**: Set up a webhook to receive survey responses. Use Pipedream to parse the response, apply any necessary logic or validation, and then insert the data into a Google Sheet for real-time analysis and reporting, enabling quick insights into survey results.
