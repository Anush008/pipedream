# Overview

HubSpot's API opens a world of CRM automation opportunities, interfacing directly with customer data, marketing campaigns, sales pipelines, and service tickets. On Pipedream, you can tap into this wellspring of data and harness HubSpot's capabilities for personalized workflows, syncing data across platforms, triggering actions based on customer interactions, and refining sales and marketing strategies through real-time analytics.

# Example Use Cases

- **Lead Scoring and Segmentation**: Enhance leads automatically by pulling in enrichment data from external sources and categorizing them in HubSpot. Use customer interaction data from social media or support platforms to adjust lead scores and segment leads into appropriate marketing campaigns within HubSpot.

- **Automated Ticketing and Support**: Create a workflow where new support queries on HubSpot trigger the creation of tickets in a tool like Zendesk. The workflow can also update the customer record in HubSpot with the ticket information, ensuring the sales team has visibility into customer issues.

- **Syncing Contacts with Email Platforms**: Set up a bi-directional sync between HubSpot and email marketing platforms like Mailchimp. When a contact is updated in HubSpot, it triggers an update in Mailchimp and vice versa. This keeps mailing lists current and enables targeted campaign efforts based on the most relevant data.
