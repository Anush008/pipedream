# Overview

The IFTTT (If This Then That) API on Pipedream allows you to create powerful, serverless workflows by connecting various apps and services. Trigger actions on IFTTT from Pipedream, or vice versa, to automate tasks across the web. With Pipedream's zero-management execution, you can focus on creating dynamic reactions to events from any number of IFTTT-supported apps.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate Social Media Posts**: Use Pipedream to monitor a database or RSS feed for new content. When new content is detected, trigger an IFTTT applet to post updates to social media platforms like Twitter or Facebook.

- **Smart Home Alerts**: Create a workflow on Pipedream that listens for webhooks from your IoT devices. Upon receiving a signal, for instance, from a smart sensor, use IFTTT to send a notification to your phone or adjust smart home settings like lighting or temperature.

- **Backup New Files to Cloud Storage**: Watch for new files in a directory on a network drive or computer using Pipedream's code steps. When a new file is spotted, trigger an IFTTT applet to save a copy to Google Drive, Dropbox, or another cloud storage service.
