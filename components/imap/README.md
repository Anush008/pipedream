# Overview

The IMAP API on Pipedream allows you to interact with email messages and mailboxes from any IMAP server. By leveraging Pipedream's capabilities, you can automate tasks such as reading messages, searching for specific emails, and triggering workflows based on incoming emails. You can create complex email processing systems without managing servers, whilst taking advantage of Pipedream's integrations with other apps for extended functionality.

# Example Use Cases

- **Email to Slack Alert**: Automatically send a Slack message when you receive an email from a VIP client. This workflow triggers when a new email hits your inbox, with conditions set to filter for emails from specific addresses, then posts a summary and link to the message in a designated Slack channel.

- **Support Ticket Creation**: Convert incoming support requests via email into tickets in a tool like Zendesk or Jira. When an email arrives at your support address, parse the content in Pipedream and use it to create a new ticket in your tracking system, streamlining your support process.

- **Email Digest**: Compile a daily or weekly digest of emails from specified folders or with particular labels, and send the digest to a Google Doc. This workflow can be scheduled to run at regular intervals, fetching emails and formatting them into a readable document that can be easily shared or archived.
