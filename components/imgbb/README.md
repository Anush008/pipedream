# Overview

The imgbb API provides a straightforward way to host images online. Integrated within Pipedream's environment, it allows you to automate the upload of images and manage hosted content with ease. Use it to trigger workflows with image content, store images from various sources, or to integrate image hosting into your app's features.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Image Backup from Social Media**: Create a Pipedream workflow that monitors your social media accounts for new images using triggers for platforms like Twitter or Instagram. Once a new image is detected, automatically upload it to imgbb for safekeeping and reference.

- **Website Content Management**: Streamline content updates on your website by setting up a Pipedream workflow where images dropped into a monitored Dropbox folder are automatically uploaded to imgbb. Use the imgbb URL in your website's CMS to keep your site's content fresh without manual uploads.

- **Email Attachments to Image Host**: With a Pipedream workflow, automatically upload image attachments from incoming emails (using a service like Gmail) to imgbb. This can be useful for support ticket systems where images need to be publicly accessible for a team to review and resolve issues.
