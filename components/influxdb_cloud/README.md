# Overview

InfluxDB Cloud API on Pipedream allows you to interact with InfluxDB Cloud's time-series database capabilities directly from your workflows. This integration enables you to automate the ingestion, querying, and management of your time series data for real-time analysis and monitoring. With Pipedreamâ€™s serverless platform, you can create event-driven workflows that respond to various triggers and interact with InfluxDB Cloud to store, retrieve, and process your metrics and events efficiently.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Data Ingestion from IoT Devices**: Create workflows that trigger on a schedule or in response to HTTP requests to ingest data from IoT sensors. The data can then be formatted and written to InfluxDB Cloud for real-time monitoring and analytics.

- **Alerting and Notification System**: Set up a workflow that queries InfluxDB Cloud at regular intervals, checks for specific conditions or thresholds, and sends alerts via email, SMS, or communication platforms like Slack if anomalies are detected.

- **Data Visualization Dashboard Updates**: Build a workflow that fetches recent data points from InfluxDB Cloud at scheduled times, processes the results, and pushes updates to a data visualization tool like Grafana for up-to-date dashboards.
