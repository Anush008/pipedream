# Example Workflows

- **SMS Order Confirmations**: Trigger an SMS confirmation message via Infobip whenever a new order is placed on your e-commerce platform, like Shopify. This workflow captures order details and sends a personalized confirmation to the customer's mobile number, improving the post-purchase experience.

- **Automated Support Ticket Alerts**: When a high-priority support ticket is created in a helpdesk app like Zendesk, use Infobip to send an urgent SMS or voice message to your support team. This ensures immediate attention to critical issues, reducing response times and enhancing service quality.

- **Event-Based Marketing Campaigns**: Deploy time-sensitive marketing campaigns by triggering emails or WhatsApp messages through Infobip based on user activities in apps like Mailchimp or HubSpot. For example, send a promotional message when a user subscribes to a newsletter or downloads a resource, facilitating targeted engagement.
