# Overview

The Keap (Infusionsoft) API lets you automate and integrate your CRM and marketing services within Pipedream's serverless platform. Using the API, you can manage contacts, create or update opportunities, automate email campaigns, and track user interactions. By connecting Keap to Pipedream, you tap into a powerful workflow engine, capable of orchestrating data flows and automating processes across various services and APIs.

# Example Use Cases

- **Sync New Leads to Google Sheets**: When a new lead is captured in Keap, automate the addition of their details to a Google Sheets spreadsheet. This workflow ensures your lead data is systematically organized and easily accessible for analysis or team collaboration.

- **Trigger SMS Notifications for New Appointments**: Set up a workflow that listens for new appointments booked through Keap and uses Twilio to send an SMS notification to the relevant staff member. This immediate alert helps your team stay updated and can increase the efficiency of appointment preparations.

- **Automate Task Creation for Sales Follow-ups**: Create a Pipedream workflow that triggers when a deal reaches a certain stage in Keap. The workflow then generates follow-up tasks in project management tools like Trello or Asana, assigning them to the right sales team members to ensure timely engagement with prospective clients.
