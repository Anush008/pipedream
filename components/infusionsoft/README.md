# Overview

The Keap (Infusionsoft) API lets you automate and integrate your CRM and marketing automation tasks seamlessly. With this API in Pipedream, you can create, update, and track contacts, trigger email campaigns, manage e-commerce operations, and synchronize data across different platforms. Pipedreamâ€™s serverless platform empowers you to build scalable, event-driven workflows with minimal setup, connecting Keap to numerous other apps and services.

# Example Use Cases

- **Sync New Stripe Customers to Keap Contacts**: Automate the process of adding new Stripe customers as contacts in your Keap account. When a new customer is created in Stripe, the workflow triggers, creating or updating the corresponding contact in Keap, ensuring your CRM is always up-to-date.

- **Schedule Email Campaigns Based on User Activity**: Trigger Keap email campaigns based on user activity tracked in your app or website. Use webhooks to capture events like sign-ups or purchase completions in Pipedream, then start a targeted Keap campaign to engage your users with relevant content at the right time.

- **Aggregate Contacts for Reporting**: Pull contact data from Keap into Google Sheets for advanced reporting and analysis. Set up a workflow that periodically fetches contact information from Keap and appends it to a Google Sheet. This can be a powerful way to visualize sales funnel progress or to perform custom data analysis.
