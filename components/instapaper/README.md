# Overview

The Instapaper API enables you to automate interactions with your Instapaper account, such as managing saved articles, folders, and bookmarks. With Pipedream, you can create workflows to add new content to Instapaper, organize your articles, or even trigger actions in other apps when specific events occur in your Instapaper account. The API's functions offer seamless integration for custom automation or complex workflows to enhance your reading experience and productivity.

# Example Use Cases

- **Save Articles from RSS Feeds**: Automatically save new articles to Instapaper whenever they're published on your favorite RSS feed. This way, you always have the latest content ready for offline reading.

- **Curate Reading List with Slack**: Push a daily digest of articles from a specific Instapaper folder to a Slack channel. Team members can stay updated with industry news or shared reading materials without leaving their workspace.

- **Archive Read Articles to Google Sheets**: After marking articles as read in Instapaper, trigger a workflow to archive their details in a Google Sheets document for future reference or analysis. This helps in maintaining a clean and organized reading list.
