# Overview

The Instapaper API lets you automate interactions with your Instapaper account, such as adding articles, managing your unread list, and organizing folders. On Pipedream, you can harness this functionality to create serverless workflows that integrate Instapaper with other apps and services. Streamline your reading habits, sync content across platforms, or trigger actions in other apps when something changes in your Instapaper account. It's all about making your article consumption and management as efficient as possible.

# Example Use Cases

- **Save Articles from RSS Feeds**: Automatically save new articles to Instapaper whenever they're published on your favorite RSS feeds. This way, you can read them later at your leisure, all while keeping them organized in one place.

- **Share Read Later List on Slack**: Share your Instapaper highlights or articles with a Slack channel. Once you mark an article as read or highlight a passage, trigger a workflow to post it to a designated Slack channel, keeping your team or friends in the loop on what you're reading.

- **Sync Instapaper with Notion**: Create a workflow that adds new Instapaper articles to a Notion database. Whenever you add an article to Instapaper, it can also appear in Notion, giving you a powerful way to archive and search through your reading material with Notion's database capabilities.
