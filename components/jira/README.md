# Overview

The Jira API taps into the core functionalities of Jira Software, a project and issue-tracking tool, allowing for programmatic interaction with Jira projects, issues, and comments. On Pipedream, you can leverage the Jira API to automate workflows, sync data across different systems, and react to events in Jira in real-time. Pipedream's serverless platform simplifies the process of setting up these integrations, providing a low-code environment to connect Jira with hundreds of other apps.

# Example Use Cases

- **Issue Lifecycle Automation**: Automate the transition of issues through their lifecycle in Jira based on triggers from other apps. For example, when a pull request is merged on GitHub, a Jira issue linked to that PR can be automatically transitioned to a "Done" status.

- **Sprint Health Reports**: Generate sprint health reports by aggregating data from active sprints in Jira. These reports can be sent to Slack at regular intervals, keeping the team informed about sprint progress without manual checks.

- **Customer Feedback to Issue Creation**: Create Jira issues from customer feedback collected through various platforms. When a customer submits feedback via Typeform, a new issue is created in Jira with all the relevant details for prioritization and tracking.
