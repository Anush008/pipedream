# Overview

The Jotform API provides a platform for you to retrieve form data, manage forms and submissions, and integrate with various services to streamline data collection and processing. Using Pipedream, you can automate workflows that trigger when new submissions are made, periodically sync data, or react to changes in form status. This enables seamless integration with other apps and services to enhance productivity and data management.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate Lead Capture to CRM**: When a new submission comes in from a Jotform lead generation form, Pipedream can capture the data and automatically add it to your CRM, such as Salesforce or HubSpot. This keeps your sales pipeline updated without manual data entry.
- **Sync Submission Data to Google Sheets**: On every new Jotform submission, trigger a Pipedream workflow that appends the submission data to a Google Sheet. This is ideal for aggregating responses for further analysis or record-keeping.
- **Email Notifications for High Priority Submissions**: Filter submissions based on certain criteria, such as a high-priority support request, and use Pipedream to send an alert email through an email service like SendGrid or directly via SMTP. This ensures critical issues are addressed promptly.
