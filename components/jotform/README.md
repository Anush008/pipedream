# Overview

The Jotform API lets you harness the power of form data collection and management, enabling you to automate processes around survey responses, application entries, or any data collection method you've implemented using Jotform forms. With Pipedream, you can trigger workflows on form submission, manipulate and route data, and link Jotform to countless other services to streamline operations, like managing leads, handling event registrations, or even updating databases in real-time.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Lead Management**: Upon submission of a Jotform lead capture form, Pipedream can trigger a workflow that enriches the lead data using Clearbit, then automatically adds the lead to a CRM system like Salesforce, and sends a personalized follow-up email via SendGrid.

- **Event Registration and Management**: When someone registers for an event using a Jotform, Pipedream can add the registrant details to a Google Sheets spreadsheet, send a calendar invite through Google Calendar, and dispatch a confirmation message with Twilio SMS.

- **Feedback Collection and Analysis**: Every time a customer feedback form is submitted, Pipedream can extract the feedback, analyze sentiment using a machine learning API like MonkeyLearn, and log the result in a Slack channel for team review, or create a ticket in Zendesk if the sentiment is negative.
