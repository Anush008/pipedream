# Overview

The Kucoin Futures API allows you to automate trading, manage your portfolio, and monitor the cryptocurrency market directly within Pipedream. With it, you can place orders, check your account balance, retrieve market data, and track contract positions programmatically. Building workflows with the Kucoin Futures API on Pipedream enables you to react to market changes in real-time, integrate with other services, and streamline your crypto trading strategy.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Trading Based on Custom Signals**: Create a workflow that listens for specific market conditions or external signals (like breaking news from an RSS feed or tweets from influential traders). When the conditions are met, the workflow places a futures trade on Kucoin.

- **Portfolio Rebalancing**: Set up a recurring workflow that periodically checks your Kucoin Futures portfolio allocation. If the portfolio drifts from your target allocation, the workflow automatically adjusts positions to rebalance it.

- **Alerts and Notifications**: Implement a workflow that monitors the futures market for significant price movements or volume changes. When a defined threshold is met, the workflow sends a real-time alert to your communication platform of choice, such as Slack or email.
