# Overview

The Line API on Pipedream enables you to automate interactions with users on Line, a popular messaging platform. With this API, you can send messages, manage chats, and leverage Line's social features to engage with users programmatically. Pipedream provides a serverless platform where you can create complex workflows that react to Line events or schedule messages, all without managing infrastructure.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Customer Support**: Build a workflow that listens for keywords or questions in Line messages and automatically responds with predefined answers, helping to manage customer inquiries at scale.

- **Scheduled Messages**: Use Pipedream's scheduled tasks to send periodic updates or reminders to Line users, ensuring that they stay engaged and informed about your services or products.

- **Cross-Platform Notification System**: Create a workflow that triggers notifications on Line whenever a specified event occurs on another app. For instance, alert a Line group chat when a new GitHub issue is created in your repository.
