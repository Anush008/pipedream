# Overview

The Linear (OAuth) API on Pipedream allows you to interact with the Linear project management platform, enabling you to automate tasks, sync data across various tools, and enhance project tracking without the need for manual intervention. With this API, you can create issues, comment on them, update statuses, and more, all within Pipedream's serverless platform. This integration is particularly useful for teams looking to streamline their project management workflows and connect their Linear data with other apps and services.

# Example Use Cases

- **Streamline Issue Creation**: Automatically create issues in Linear whenever a new form response is received from a tool like Typeform. This allows you to quickly capture user feedback or bug reports and funnel them into your development pipeline.

- **Sync Task Status with Slack**: Keep your team informed by sending updates to a designated Slack channel when the status of a Linear issue changes. This can help ensure everyone is on the same page with the project's progress and any blockers are communicated effectively.

- **Automate Issue Assignment**: Connect Linear with Google Sheets to automatically assign new issues to team members based on specific criteria. For example, you could have a Sheet that maps areas of responsibility, and when a new issue comes in, it's assigned to the relevant team member.
