# Overview

The Linear (API key) API opens up a wealth of possibilities for integrating and automating your project management tasks within Pipedream. Pipedream's serverless platform allows you to create workflows that interact with Linear's API to manage issues, projects, and teams programmatically. You can trigger actions based on a variety of events, and connect Linear with hundreds of other apps to streamline your processes.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Issue Creation in Linear from GitHub Events**: Create issues in Linear automatically whenever a GitHub pull request is opened or an issue is labeled with a specific tag. This keeps your project management in sync with your codebase changes without manual intervention.

- **Slack Notifications for Linear Task Updates**: Set up a Pipedream workflow that listens for changes to tasks in Linear, such as status updates or new comments, and sends a corresponding message to a designated Slack channel. This way, your team stays informed in real-time about project progress.

- **Daily Summary Reports to Email**: Generate a daily summary report of a project's status in Linear and send it through email using the SendGrid app. Collect data like completed tasks, newly created issues, and pending reviews, and compile them into a digestible format to keep stakeholders updated.
