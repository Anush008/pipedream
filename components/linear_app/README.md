# Overview

The Linear (API key) API lets you interact with Linear, a project management and issue tracking tool designed for modern software teams. By leveraging this API on Pipedream, you can automate workflows, sync data across platforms, and create intricate actions triggered by events in Linear. Whether you're managing tasks, collaborating with team members, or integrating project data with other services, the Linear API on Pipedream offers a robust solution for maximizing efficiency and streamlining operations within your software development lifecycle.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate Task Creation for New Support Tickets**: When a new support ticket is created in your customer service platform (e.g., Zendesk), you can automatically create a corresponding task in Linear. This ensures that customer issues are tracked and managed promptly by your development team.

- **Synchronize Issues with Code Commits**: Link commits from your version control system (e.g., GitHub) to Linear issues automatically. Each time a commit is made referencing a Linear issue ID, update the issue in Linear with the commit details. This keeps all stakeholders informed of development progress in real-time.

- **Streamline Project Management with Calendar Sync**: Sync your Linear milestones and due dates with a calendar service (e.g., Google Calendar). This workflow can automatically create and update calendar events based on Linear project timelines, ensuring that all team members have visibility into deadlines and important dates.
