# Overview

The Mailchimp API lets you manage subscribers, send emails, and track campaign results, essentially automating your email marketing efforts. It's a powerful way to sync email campaigns with user data from your app, respond to subscriber activity, and personalize your marketing efforts. Within Pipedream, you can leverage this API to create workflows that react to various triggers, such as new subscribers, campaign status updates, or audience changes, and integrate with other services for enhanced functionality.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate Welcome Emails**: Trigger a workflow in Pipedream when a new user signs up on your platform, adding them to a Mailchimp audience and sending a personalized welcome email.

- **Sync Subscriber Lists with CRM**: Maintain your subscriber lists in sync with your CRM tool, such as Salesforce or HubSpot. Whenever a new contact is added to your CRM, add them to a specified Mailchimp list and tag them based on their CRM data.

- **Monitor Campaign Performance**: Set up a workflow to monitor Mailchimp campaign performance metrics. When a campaign reaches certain thresholds for opens or clicks, automatically post a summary to a Slack channel to keep your team informed.
