# Overview

The Mailchimp API opens a door to robust email marketing automation capabilities. With it, you can manage lists, campaigns, reports, and much more programmatically. Pipedream, as a serverless platform, is the perfect partner for this API, allowing you to create intricate workflows with triggers and actions that interact with Mailchimp data. From syncing subscribers to sending targeted campaigns based on external events, the integration opportunities are vast.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automatic Subscriber Sync**: Create a workflow that listens for new sign-ups on your platform and automatically adds them as subscribers to a specified Mailchimp audience. This keeps your email lists fresh and updated without manual intervention.

- **Dynamic Content Campaigns**: Set up a workflow that triggers when your e-commerce platform records a new purchase. It can fetch related product details and use them to send a personalized follow-up campaign through Mailchimp, enhancing customer experience.

- **Survey Response Follow-Up**: After a user completes a survey via a tool like Typeform, trigger a Pipedream workflow that adds the user to a Mailchimp audience segment based on their responses and sends a follow-up email tailored to their interests.
