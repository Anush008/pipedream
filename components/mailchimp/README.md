# Overview

The Mailchimp API offers robust features for email marketing automation, allowing users to manage audiences, campaigns, and reports. With Pipedream, you can harness this API to create powerful serverless workflows, integrating Mailchimp with other apps to automate tasks like syncing subscriber lists, triggering email campaigns based on external events, and analyzing campaign performance with custom metrics.

# Example Use Cases

- **Sync New eCommerce Customers to Mailchimp Audience**: Automatically add new customers from an eCommerce platform like Shopify to a specified Mailchimp audience. Use this to keep your subscriber list up-to-date and send targeted email campaigns to new customers.

- **Trigger Campaigns from CRM Updates**: When a contact is updated in your CRM, such as Salesforce, trigger a Mailchimp campaign to send personalized information or offers. This workflow ensures timely communication that is aligned with the customer's journey in your sales funnel.

- **Analyze Campaign Performance in Google Sheets**: After a Mailchimp campaign is sent, use Pipedream to fetch the campaign report and append the data to a Google Sheets document. This enables easy tracking and sharing of campaign performance metrics within your team.
