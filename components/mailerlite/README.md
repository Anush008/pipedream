# Overview

The MailerLite API on Pipedream provides a powerful way to automate email marketing tasks by interacting with your subscriber lists, campaigns, and reports directly through pre-built actions or custom code steps. You can create dynamic workflows that respond to events in MailerLite or initiate actions based on triggers from other apps. Pipedream's serverless platform enables these automations to run without the need for a dedicated server, making it a cost-effective and scalable solution for businesses of any size.

# Example Use Cases

- **Send Slack Notifications for New Subscriber Activity**: Get instant Slack messages when someone subscribes or unsubscribes from your MailerLite lists. Keep your team in the loop with subscriber trends without having to manually check your dashboard.

- **Automatically Tag Subscribers Based on Survey Responses**: Use Pipedream to listen for new survey responses via Typeform, then tag the corresponding subscribers in MailerLite based on their answers. This enables targeted email campaigns tailored to subscriber preferences.
