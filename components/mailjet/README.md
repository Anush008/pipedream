# Overview

The Mailjet API provides a platform for email service management, allowing users to send transactional and marketing emails, manage contacts, create and manage email campaigns, and track email performance with analytics. On Pipedream, you can harness the Mailjet API to automate email workflows, integrate with other apps to enhance marketing strategies, and streamline communication processes. Leveraging Pipedream's serverless execution model, you can set up event-driven workflows with Mailjet to react to new subscriber sign-ups, support queries, or any other email-triggered event.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Welcome Emails**: When a new user signs up on your platform, trigger a workflow on Pipedream that sends a personalized welcome email from Mailjet. This can help improve user onboarding and engagement.

- **Support Ticket Creation**: Integrate Mailjet with a support ticket app like Zendesk. When an email is received to a particular Mailjet address, parse the email content and automatically create a new support ticket in Zendesk.

- **Sync Contacts with CRM**: Keep your CRM up-to-date by syncing it with your Mailjet contact list. When a new contact is added in Mailjet, use Pipedream to add or update the contact in your CRM system, such as Salesforce.
