# Overview

Mautic, an open-source marketing automation platform, provides a powerful API that lets you interact with your marketing data programmatically. With Pipedream, you can harness this API to create bespoke workflows that automate your marketing processes, sync data between platforms, and react to events in real-time. Whether you're managing contacts, campaigns, or measuring analytics, integrating Mautic with Pipedream simplifies complex tasks, cutting them down to size.

# Example Use Cases

- **Sync Mautic Contacts with a CRM**: Automatically sync new or updated contacts between Mautic and your preferred CRM platform. When a contact is added or modified in Mautic, trigger a Pipedream workflow that updates the contact's information in the CRM, ensuring consistent data across platforms.

- **Automate Campaign Follow-ups**: Create a workflow that listens for webhook events from Mautic indicating a user has completed a certain action, like downloading an eBook. Use this trigger to automatically enroll the contact into a tailored follow-up email sequence in Mautic, or another email platform, to keep the conversation going.

- **Lead Scoring with Custom Logic**: Implement a Pipedream workflow that reacts to changes in a contact's engagement level, as tracked by Mautic. Apply custom logic to assign or adjust lead scores based on the contact's behavior, and then use this data to segment contacts into different nurturing streams or notify your sales team of hot leads.
