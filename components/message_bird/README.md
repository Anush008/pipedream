# Overview

The Message Bird API on Pipedream allows you to craft communication strategies with SMS, voice, and chat integrations. Harness the power of automated messaging to interact with customers, send alerts, and verify user identity with a simple integration into your workflows. With Pipedream's serverless platform, you can easily connect Message Bird to various services and trigger actions based on message events, streamlining conversations and notifications without managing infrastructure.

# Example Use Cases

- **Customer Support Ticket Alerting**: Integrate Message Bird with a ticketing system (like Zendesk) on Pipedream. When a new support ticket is created, trigger a workflow that sends an SMS to the assigned support agent, ensuring they're informed and can respond quickly.

- **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: Enhance security by adding 2FA to your authentication flow. When a user attempts to log in, trigger a workflow that uses Message Bird to send a one-time passcode via SMS. Once the user inputs the correct code, the workflow validates it and grants access.

- **Appointment Reminders**: Connect Message Bird to a calendar app (like Google Calendar) on Pipedream. Set up a workflow that automatically sends SMS reminders to clients about their upcoming appointments, reducing no-shows and improving client relations.
