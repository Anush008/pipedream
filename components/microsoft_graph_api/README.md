# Overview

The Microsoft Graph API provides a unified gateway to access data across various Microsoft services, including Office 365, Windows 10, and Enterprise Mobility + Security. With it on Pipedream, you can automate workflows that involve emails, calendar appointments, contacts, tasks, and much more. It's a treasure trove for creating powerful automations that streamline business processes, enhance productivity, and leverage the vast ecosystem of Microsoft.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate Event Creation in Outlook Calendar**: Trigger a workflow on Pipedream to create a new event in a user's Outlook Calendar whenever a new row is added to a Google Sheets spreadsheet. This is perfect for automated scheduling and appointment setting.

- **Manage OneDrive Files Upon GitHub Commit**: Set up a Pipedream workflow to upload new files to OneDrive or update existing files whenever a commit is made to a specific GitHub repository. This ensures your documentation or code backups are always up-to-date.

- **Sync Tasks from Microsoft To Do to Trello**: Create a workflow that syncs new or updated tasks from Microsoft To Do to a Trello board. Every time a task is added or modified in Microsoft To Do, a corresponding card is created or updated in Trello, keeping project management in sync across platforms.
