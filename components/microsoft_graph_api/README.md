# Overview

The Microsoft Graph API is a powerhouse for interfacing with Microsoft 365 services, providing access to a wealth of data across various Microsoft applications like Outlook, Excel, OneDrive, and more. In Pipedream, you can leverage this API to automate workflows, sync data across apps, and build powerful integrations. Whether you're managing user identities, automating office tasks, or analyzing organizational data, the Microsoft Graph API in Pipedream offers a canvas to stitch together the capabilities of Microsoft services with minimal fuss and maximum efficiency.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate Calendar Event Creation**: Instantly create events in a user's Outlook calendar when a trigger from another app, such as a new row added in Google Sheets, occurs. Use the Google Sheets Pipedream integration to listen for changes and then call the Microsoft Graph API to update the calendar.

- **Sync New Emails to a CRM**: Keep your CRM up-to-date by syncing new emails from Outlook. Set up a Pipedream workflow to trigger on new emails and use an action to create or update contacts in a CRM like Salesforce. This ensures your sales or support team has the latest information at their fingertips.

- **Manage OneDrive Files Automatically**: Set up a workflow to monitor changes in a OneDrive folder and perform actions like sending notifications via Slack, or processing data files with Azure Functions. For instance, when a new document is uploaded, trigger a Pipedream workflow that uses the Microsoft Graph API to grab the file, and then call an Azure Function to process the contents.
