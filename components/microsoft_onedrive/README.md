# Overview

With the Microsoft OneDrive API on Pipedream, you can automate file management tasks, streamline content collaboration, and integrate with other cloud services. Perform actions like uploading, downloading, and sharing files, managing folders, and tracking changes in a user's drive. By coupling OneDrive with Pipedream's capabilities, you can create workflows to handle file synchronization, backup operations, and more, triggered by various events or on a schedule.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Backup to OneDrive**: Create a workflow that backs up important data from your web applications to OneDrive. For instance, after a user submits a form on your site, use Pipedream to save a copy of the submission to a OneDrive folder for safekeeping.

- **Content Change Notifications**: Keep a keen eye on a specific folder in OneDrive. Whenever a file is added, updated, or removed, trigger a Pipedream workflow to send an alert via email, Slack, or another preferred communication app, keeping you and your team in the loop.

- **Sync OneDrive Files with Google Drive**: Establish a two-way sync between OneDrive and Google Drive. When new files are added or existing files are updated in OneDrive, Pipedream can automatically copy or update those files in Google Drive, ensuring both storage services mirror each other.
