# Overview

The Microsoft OneDrive API on Pipedream allows you to automate file management, share content, and collaborate effortlessly. You can create workflows that trigger on file changes, upload or download files, and manage file permissions, all within the cloud storage service. By leveraging Pipedream's serverless platform, you can integrate OneDrive with other apps to create powerful automated solutions that save time and reduce manual effort.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Backup to OneDrive**: Trigger a workflow that automatically backs up new files from your local server to OneDrive whenever they are created. Combine this with a Cron Scheduler in Pipedream to ensure regular backups.

- **Process New OneDrive Files**: Create a workflow that triggers when a new file is added to OneDrive. This could be used to convert uploaded images to a different format, extract text from documents using an OCR service, or even send an alert to Slack with the file details.

- **Sync OneDrive Files to Other Cloud Services**: Set up a workflow that syncs new or updated files from OneDrive to other cloud storage services like Google Drive or Dropbox. This ensures you have redundant copies of your important files and helps maintain a unified view of your documents across platforms.
