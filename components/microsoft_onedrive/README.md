# Overview

The Microsoft OneDrive API on Pipedream allows you to automate file management and enhance collaborative efforts. Through Pipedream's serverless platform, you can build workflows that trigger on file changes, share content with colleagues, automate back-up processes, and connect OneDrive with other apps to streamline data flow. The API provides functionalities to create, read, update, and delete files and folders, as well as manage sharing and permission settings, enabling you to harness the full potential of cloud storage within your automated workflows.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Backup to OneDrive**: Save new or updated files from other apps or services to OneDrive automatically. For instance, any new Google Sheets files could be backed up to a OneDrive folder, providing an extra layer of data redundancy.

- **Content Approval Workflow**: Create a workflow that moves documents to a "pending approval" folder in OneDrive. When a document is reviewed and approved, it could be automatically moved to an "approved" folder and an email notification sent to the team via an SMTP service like SendGrid.

- **Sync Photos with Social Media**: Whenever new photos are added to a specified OneDrive folder, they could be automatically posted to a social media platform like Instagram, keeping your feed fresh with minimal effort.
