# Overview

The Microsoft OneDrive API, accessible through Pipedream, enables seamless integration and automation of file management tasks in the cloud. With this API, you can upload, download, and manage files and folders, share content, and collaborate with users within your organization or externally. Harnessing the OneDrive API via Pipedream allows for the creation of custom workflows, connecting to hundreds of other apps, and processing data without managing servers.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Backup to OneDrive**: Trigger a workflow on Pipedream that periodically backs up important files from your server to OneDrive, ensuring your data is securely stored in the cloud. This can be set up to run on a schedule, providing a hands-off approach to data redundancy.
- **Photo Sync from Social Media to OneDrive**: Create a workflow that listens for new photos on your social media platforms, such as Instagram or Facebook. When a new photo is detected, automatically upload it to a specified album in OneDrive, keeping all your memories in one place without manual effort.
- **Invoice Processing and Archiving**: Whenever a new invoice is received via email (e.g., Gmail), use Pipedream to extract the invoice, then upload it to a dedicated OneDrive folder for accounting. This workflow can be enhanced with additional steps, such as notifying your finance team on Slack or updating a record in your CRM system.
