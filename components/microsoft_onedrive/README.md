# Overview

The Microsoft OneDrive API on Pipedream opens the door to creating and managing files and folders in a user's OneDrive storage space programmatically. Through Pipedream's serverless platform, you can harness this API to automate file operations like uploading, downloading, or syncing files, managing sharing permissions, or triggering workflows based on file changes. This integration can streamline document handling, backup processes, and team collaboration by interfacing with a user's cloud storage in real-time.

# Example Use Cases

- **Intelligent Content Distribution:** Create a Pipedream workflow that monitors a OneDrive folder for new marketing materials and automatically shares them with a predefined email list or via platforms like Slack or Teams. Perfect for making sure your team always has the latest resources at their fingertips.
