# Overview

The Microsoft Outlook API on Pipedream allows you to automate interactions with your email, calendar, and contacts. It offers endpoints for sending and receiving emails, managing calendar events, and handling contacts. By leveraging these endpoints, you can create powerful automations that save time and streamline your productivity.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Email Responses**: Set up a workflow that listens for incoming emails matching certain criteria (like emails from a specific domain) and automatically replies with a pre-defined message or a dynamically generated response based on the email's content.

- **Calendar Event Management**: Create a workflow that monitors your calendar for new events and performs actions such as sending out reminders to participants, syncing these events to another calendar service, or even creating tasks in a project management tool linked to specific meetings.

- **Contact Syncing Between Platforms**: Implement a workflow that, upon adding a new contact in Outlook, automatically adds that contact to your CRM platform, such as Salesforce or HubSpot, ensuring your contact lists are always synchronized across your business tools.
