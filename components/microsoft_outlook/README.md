# Overview

The Microsoft Outlook API on Pipedream allows you to automate various aspects of email management, calendar scheduling, and contact handling. With this integration, you can build workflows to streamline your inbox, set up meetings without the back-and-forth, and keep your contact list updated. Pipedream's serverless platform facilitates the creation of complex sequences of actions triggered by new emails, events, or changes in your Outlook account, all without writing a single line of server-side code.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Email Responses**: Trigger a workflow on Pipedream when new emails arrive in your Outlook inbox that match certain criteria. For instance, automatically send a response to confirm receipt or direct common queries to the appropriate department or knowledge base.

- **Meeting Scheduling Assistant**: Combine Outlook Calendar events with a scheduling tool like Calendly. When a new event is created in Outlook, Pipedream can be used to block off that time in Calendly, ensuring you avoid double-booking.

- **Sync Contacts with CRM**: When new contacts are added to Outlook, use Pipedream to push these contacts to a CRM platform such as Salesforce. Conversely, when a new contact is added to your CRM, update or create the contact in Outlook to keep both systems in sync.
