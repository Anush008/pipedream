# Overview

The Microsoft Outlook Calendar API on Pipedream lets you tap into the rich calendar functionality of Outlook. You can create, read, update, and delete calendar events. Automate reminders, sync events with other calendar services, and manage attendee responses. It's a powerful way to integrate calendar data into your workflows, allowing for seamless scheduling and event management automation.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Event Creation from Emails:**: When a specific type of email is received, such as a meeting request, a Pipedream workflow automatically parses the email content and creates a new event in the Outlook Calendar, ensuring you never miss adding important events.

- **Meeting Room Booker:**: Connect the Outlook Calendar API with a room booking system. The workflow checks room availability in Outlook Calendar and, upon a booking request from a user via a web form or chatbot, it books an available room and sends meeting invites to participants.

- **Sync Outlook Calendar with Google Calendar:**: Create a workflow that synchronizes events between Microsoft Outlook Calendar and Google Calendar. Whenever a new event is added or updated in one calendar, the corresponding event is created or updated in the other calendar, keeping both calendars in sync.
