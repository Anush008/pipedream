# Overview

The Microsoft Outlook Calendar API lets you tap into the robust features of Microsoft's calendaring application directly from Pipedream. With this API, you can create, read, update, and delete calendar entries, respond to event invitations, and view user availability, making it perfect for automating calendar management and integrating scheduling capabilities into your workflows. Pipedream's serverless platform amplifies these abilities, allowing you to create complex automations that trigger actions in Outlook Calendar in response to events from other apps or according to a schedule.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Meeting Prep**: Set up a workflow that triggers before a meeting starts, fetching relevant documents from Google Drive and sending them to the meeting participants via Outlook email.

- **Smart Event Rescheduler**: Build a workflow that monitors your Outlook Calendar for any changes in events and automatically updates connected apps, like Todoist, to reschedule tasks associated with the events.

- **Daily Agenda Digest**: Create a daily workflow that compiles your Outlook Calendar events for the day, formats them into a digest, and then posts it to a Slack channel, keeping your team in the loop about your availability.
