# Overview

The Microsoft Teams API on Pipedream enables seamless integration and automation of your Teams workspace. With this API, you can automate messages, manage teams and channels, and streamline approvals and notifications directly in your workspace. It's a robust tool for enhancing collaboration, cutting down on repetitive tasks, and connecting Teams with other services for a cohesive workflow ecosystem.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Standup Bot**: Create a workflow that triggers a daily message in a specific team or channel asking for standup updates. Collect responses and compile them into a single report, then post it back to the channel or send to managers via email.

- **Approval Workflow Integration**: Set up a workflow that listens for new approval requests submitted through a form or another app, posts a card to a Teams channel for review, and upon approval, updates the status in your project management tool (like Trello or Asana).

- **Cross-Platform Event Notifications**: Design a workflow that detects when a new event is created in a calendar app like Google Calendar, then automatically sends a customizable notification to a designated Teams channel, ensuring that all team members are aware of upcoming meetings and events.
