# Overview

The MongoDB API allows you to interact with your MongoDB databases programmatically, enabling you to manage collections, documents, indexes, and much more directly from Pipedream. With this powerful integration, you can craft workflows that automate database operations in response to events from over 800+ apps available on Pipedream, or by HTTP requests, scheduled triggers, and more.

# Example Use Cases

- **Real-Time Data Sync from CRMs to MongoDB**: Automatically sync new customer data from a CRM like Salesforce or HubSpot into your MongoDB collection whenever a new contact is added or updated, keeping your database effortlessly up-to-date.

- **Content Management Workflow**: Trigger a workflow that fetches new content from sources like RSS feeds or APIs (like WordPress or Contentful) and stores it in MongoDB. You can use this to maintain a fresh and dynamic content repository, which can then be served through your applications.

- **IoT Data Aggregation**: Integrate with IoT platforms like Particle or Arduino, to collect sensor data and insert it into MongoDB. Aggregate data over time and trigger actions or notifications based on specific sensor readings, like temperature thresholds or motion detection events.
