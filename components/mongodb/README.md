# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Data Sync between MongoDB and Google Sheets**: Sync new MongoDB documents to a Google Sheet automatically. Whenever a document is added to a specified collection, a workflow is triggered to insert its details into a Google Sheet, enabling non-technical team members to review and work with the data.

- **Scheduled Data Backup to Dropbox**: Set up a routine that exports data from MongoDB and sends it to Dropbox at regular intervals. This workflow can compress a collection into a backup file and upload it to Dropbox, providing you with a reliable and automated backup solution.

- **Real-time Notifications for MongoDB Document Changes**: Get instant alerts when documents in a MongoDB collection are modified. This workflow can monitor changes and send notifications through email, Slack, or other messaging platforms, keeping you informed about database activity in real-time.
