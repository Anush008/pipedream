# Overview

Using the MongoDB API with Pipedream enables developers to build powerful data-driven workflows. Pipedream's serverless platform lets you connect MongoDB to hundreds of other apps and services. You can trigger workflows on specific database events, perform CRUD operations, and synchronize your MongoDB data with other databases or SaaS tools. By leveraging Pipedream's capabilities, you can automate repetitive tasks, sync data across platforms, and respond to data changes in real-time.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Data Backup**: Trigger a workflow to automatically export collections from MongoDB and save them to cloud storage like Google Drive or Dropbox. This way, you ensure regular backups of your database without manual intervention.

- **Real-time Analytics Dashboard Update**: Connect MongoDB to a data visualization tool like Google Sheets or Tableau. Whenever new data is inserted into MongoDB, the Pipedream workflow can push this data to the dashboard, keeping your analytics up-to-date without polling the database.

- **Customer Support Ticket Integration**: When a new support ticket is created in a tool like Zendesk, use Pipedream to check if the user exists in your MongoDB users collection. If not, add them, or update their record with the new ticket info, ensuring your user database is always synchronized with customer interactions.
