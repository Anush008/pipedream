# Overview

The MySQL API on Pipedream enables you to run SQL queries and manage your MySQL databases directly within the platform. With Pipedream, you can quickly create, read, update, and delete records, and even listen for new rows in your database tables. Integrating MySQL into serverless workflows opens up a myriad of automation possibilities, such as syncing data between different systems, triggering actions based on database events, and generating reportsâ€”all without managing infrastructure.

# Example Use Cases

- **MySQL to Slack Notifications**: Whenever a new row is added to your MySQL database, Pipedream can trigger a workflow that sends a customized notification to a designated Slack channel. This is perfect for sales teams to get real-time updates on new orders.

- **MySQL Data Aggregation and Google Sheets Reporting**: Run a scheduled workflow in Pipedream that fetches and aggregates data from various MySQL tables, then append the results to a Google Sheet for easily digestible reports. This can automate your data analysis, saving time and ensuring consistent updates.

- **MySQL Backup to AWS S3**: Create a workflow that periodically exports selected data from MySQL and stores it securely in an AWS S3 bucket. This can serve as an automated backup solution or a part of a larger data archiving strategy.
