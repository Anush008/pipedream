# Overview

The MySQL API on Pipedream allows you to harness the power of your MySQL databases within serverless workflows. You can execute SQL queries, manage tables, retrieve, insert, update, or delete data, and trigger actions based on changes in your database. By leveraging these capabilities, you can create automated processes that react in real-time to database events, synchronize data across platforms, or even generate reports and alerts based on data-driven insights.

# Example Use Cases

- **Order Processing Automation**: Automatically validate and process new orders. When a new order is inserted into the MySQL database, trigger a Pipedream workflow that checks inventory levels, updates stock quantities, and sends a confirmation email to the customer using an email service like SendGrid.

- **Customer Data Synchronization**: Keep customer information in sync across different platforms. Use a Pipedream workflow to listen for updates in your MySQL customer table, and when a change is detected, update corresponding records in a CRM like Salesforce or HubSpot, ensuring all teams have access to the latest data.

- **Real-time Data Backup**: Create a Pipedream workflow that periodically queries your MySQL database and backs up the results to a cloud storage service such as Google Drive or Dropbox. This provides an additional layer of data security, ensuring you have accessible backups without manual intervention.
