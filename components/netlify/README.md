# Overview

The Netlify API offers a range of capabilities for automating and managing Netlify services, like site deployments, domain management, and build hooks. On Pipedream, you can craft serverless workflows that leverage these functionalities to streamline your development and deployment processes, integrate with other apps, and react to various events. By using Pipedream's ability to connect to hundreds of other services, you can create powerful automations that trigger Netlify actions and react to Netlify events with minimal effort.

# Example Use Cases

- **Continuous Deployment Pipeline**: Trigger a Netlify build whenever a new commit is pushed to a specific branch in a GitHub repository. Use Pipedream's GitHub app to listen for `push` events and then call Netlify's build hook to deploy the latest changes.

- **Monitor Deployment Status**: Keep track of your Netlify deployment statuses by setting up a Pipedream workflow that listens to Netlify's deployment webhook. Whenever a deployment is completed, send a notification with the deployment details to a Slack channel to keep your team informed.

- **Automated Domain Management**: Automatically update DNS records on Netlify when a new domain is purchased on a platform like GoDaddy. Start with a Pipedream workflow that listens for domain purchase events from GoDaddy, then use the Netlify API to create or update the corresponding DNS records on Netlify.
