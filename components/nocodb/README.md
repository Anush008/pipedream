# Overview

The NocoDB API turns your databases into a smart spreadsheet interface, allowing for CRUD operations on your data. With Pipedream's ability to connect to virtually any API, you can leverage NocoDB's API to automate database operations, sync data across multiple platforms, and create dynamic, serverless workflows. On Pipedream, you can trigger workflows using various events, from webhooks to schedules, and use NocoDB's API for intricate data manipulation, analysis, or reporting tasks.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Data Entry Workflow**: Trigger a workflow on Pipedream when a form is submitted on your website or app. Use the NocoDB API to add this new data directly into your database, keeping your records up to date without manual input.

- **Database Syncing Workflow**: Sync contacts between NocoDB and a CRM tool like Salesforce. When new contacts are added or updated in NocoDB, the changes are automatically reflected in Salesforce, ensuring consistent data across your business tools.

- **Issue Tracker Integration**: Connect NocoDB with a project management tool like GitHub. When an issue is marked as resolved in GitHub, the workflow updates the corresponding record in NocoDB to reflect the change, maintaining an accurate project status overview.
