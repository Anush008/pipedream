# Overview

The OCRSpace API turns images and PDF documents into editable text through its optical character recognition (OCR) service. With Pipedream, you can automate workflows by connecting OCRSpace to various other services or internal processes. Extract data from scanned documents, analyze images for text content, or archive information by converting it to searchable text. Pipedream's serverless platform makes it simple to trigger these OCR tasks with webhooks, schedule them, or integrate them with countless other apps, without the hassle of managing infrastructure.

# Example Use Cases

- **Document Data Extraction to Google Sheets**: Automatically extract text from uploaded documents and append the extracted data to a Google Sheet. This is perfect for digitizing paper forms or archiving invoices.

- **Image Text Moderation with Content Moderation APIs**: Use OCR to extract text from images and then pass that text to a content moderation API to detect inappropriate or sensitive content, ensuring user-generated images are safe for public display.

- **Receipt Scanning for Expense Tracking**: Scan receipts using OCRSpace and send the extracted text data to an expense management app like Expensify or to a custom database, streamlining expense reporting and tracking.
