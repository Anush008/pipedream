# Overview

OneSignal's REST API lets you automate and scale your mobile and web push notification services. Integrating with Pipedream's serverless platform opens up possibilities for orchestrating complex workflows. You could trigger notifications based on user behavior, synchronize user data across platforms, or manage notification campaigns in response to real-time events. With Pipedream, you can connect OneSignal to hundreds of apps, enabling you to create personalized, timely, and automated communication streams with ease.

# Example Use Cases

- **User Activity-Based Notifications**: Trigger push notifications via OneSignal when users perform specific actions. For instance, if a user abandons a cart on your e-commerce platform, you could send them a reminder notification. This workflow could integrate with an e-commerce platform like Shopify to monitor cart status.

- **Automated Welcome Messages**: Send automated welcome push notifications to new users who sign up for your service. The workflow can be crafted to listen for new signups via a webhook from your user management system, such as Auth0, and then action a welcome message through OneSignal.

- **Sync User Segments**: Keep your users' segments up to date by synchronizing them with your CRM. Whenever a user's property is updated in your CRM (e.g., Salesforce), use Pipedream to reflect those changes in OneSignal's user segments to ensure targeted communication.
