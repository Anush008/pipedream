# Overview

The OneSignal REST API brings the power of targeted and automated notifications into your Pipedream workflows. With this API, you can create and manage notifications, user segments, and app settings programmatically. It's perfect for engaging users with timely updates, driving app usage, and tailoring communications based on user behavior. Integrate OneSignal with other services on Pipedream to craft complex, event-driven workflows that respond to actions in real-time.

# Example Use Cases

- **User Activity Triggered Notifications**: When a user completes an action in your app (like achieving a high score or making a purchase), you could use Pipedream to trigger a congratulatory or thank-you notification via OneSignal. This could foster user engagement and positive reinforcement.

- **Scheduled Digests**: Compile user activity or content updates from your platform into scheduled digest notifications. For instance, you could set up a workflow that pulls the latest blog posts from a CMS like WordPress (available on Pipedream), formats them, and sends a weekly update to your users through OneSignal.

- **Dynamic Segment Notifications**: Create a workflow that monitors your database (using SQL or a NoSQL database app on Pipedream) for changes in user attributes or behavior. Use this information to dynamically segment users within OneSignal and send targeted notifications, such as re-engagement messages to users who haven't opened the app in a while.
