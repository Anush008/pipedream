# Overview

The OpenSea API offers a gateway to interact with the world's first and largest NFT marketplace. On Pipedream, you can harness this API to create automated workflows that react to events on OpenSea, query for NFT data, and integrate with other services for a myriad of purposes. For instance, you can track asset events, monitor collections, or respond to user activities. With Pipedream's serverless platform, you can set up scheduled or event-driven workflows that use OpenSea's rich data to fuel your applications, analytics, or personal notifications.

# Example Use Cases

- **Track New NFT Listings**: Create a workflow that monitors a particular collection on OpenSea for new listings. Once a new NFT is listed, use the Slack app on Pipedream to send a notification with details about the listing to a Slack channel.

- **Monitor NFT Price Changes**: Set up a workflow that polls OpenSea's API for price changes in your favorite NFT collections. When a significant price change is detected, trigger an email alert via the Gmail app on Pipedream to keep you updated.

- **Automate NFT Purchase Process**: Develop a workflow that watches for NFTs listed below a certain price threshold and automatically initiates a purchase on OpenSea using a connected wallet. Post-purchase, log the transaction details to a Google Sheets spreadsheet for record-keeping.
