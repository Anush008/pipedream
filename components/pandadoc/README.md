# Example Use Cases

- **Automate Document Creation from CRM Deals**: Trigger a document creation in PandaDoc automatically when a new deal is marked as 'won' in your CRM system, like Salesforce or HubSpot. Auto-fill the document with deal info and send it for e-signature without manual entry.

- **Send and Track Proposals for E-Commerce Orders**: When a high-value order is placed through an e-commerce platform such as Shopify, use Pipedream to create a detailed proposal in PandaDoc. Follow up with automated emails through SendGrid or Mailgun based on the document's status updates.

- **Onboard New Employees with Pre-filled HR Documents**: Kickstart the onboarding process by generating necessary HR documents in PandaDoc when a new employee is added to HR systems like BambooHR or Workday. Automate the flow of filling out forms with personal details and send them to the new hires for signing.
