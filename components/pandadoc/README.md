# Overview

PandaDoc API on Pipedream allows for powerful document automationâ€”create, send and track documents seamlessly. With this integration, you can streamline document workflows, inject data from various sources, and trigger actions based on document status. Automate proposals, contracts, HR documents, and more.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Contract Creation**: Trigger a workflow when a new deal is closed in your CRM, such as Salesforce, to automatically create and send a PandaDoc contract using customer data from the CRM.

- **Document Status Tracking to Slack**: Set up a workflow that listens for status updates on documents in PandaDoc and sends notifications to a designated Slack channel. This keeps your team instantly informed about document views, completions, and signatures.

- **Data Collection for Document Generation**: Combine PandaDoc with Google Forms to collect information. When a form is submitted, use that data to populate and send a document via PandaDoc, simplifying the collection and usage of user-provided information.
