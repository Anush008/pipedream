# Overview

The pCloud API provides programmatic access to pCloud's cloud storage features, allowing for file uploads, downloads, sharing, and folder management among other operations. With Pipedream's integration capabilities, you can create workflows that automate file management, synchronization and even collaborate across other apps. Think auto-syncing photos with a database, or updating shared documents post feedback from a Slack channelâ€”Pipedream turns the pCloud API into a powerhouse for file-centric automation.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Backup to pCloud**: Create a workflow that automatically backs up important files from your local server to pCloud. Whenever new files are saved to a specific directory on your server, Pipedream can trigger an upload to a designated pCloud folder, ensuring your files are safely stored in the cloud.

- **Sync Photos with Social Media**: Anytime you add new photos to a specific pCloud folder, Pipedream can post them to your social media accounts, like Instagram or Facebook. This is perfect for photographers or marketers who want to streamline their content deployment.

- **Collaborative Document Updates via Slack**: When a document in a pCloud folder is updated, use Pipedream to send a notification with a share link to a Slack channel. This keeps teams informed and makes it easy for stakeholders to review the latest version of the document right from their Slack environment.
