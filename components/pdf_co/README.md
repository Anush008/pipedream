# Example Use Cases

- **Automate Invoice Data Extraction**: Extract invoice data using PDF.co and send it to Google Sheets using Pipedream. Whenever a new invoice is uploaded to Dropbox, Pipedream triggers a workflow that uses PDF.co to extract data and appends it to a Google Sheets spreadsheet, streamlining your financial processes.

- **Merge User Documents for Profile Compilation**: When new user documents are uploaded to a cloud storage service like AWS S3, trigger a Pipedream workflow that employs PDF.co to merge them into a single PDF. The unified document can then be archived or sent via email, simplifying user document management.

- **Generate PDF Reports from CRM Data**: Create workflows in Pipedream that activate on a schedule to fetch data from a CRM like Salesforce. Use PDF.co to convert this data into a formatted PDF report. The report can be emailed to stakeholders or saved back into Salesforce as a record attachment, ensuring consistent and automated reporting.
