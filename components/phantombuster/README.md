# Overview

Phantombuster provides a set of APIs that let you automate actions on the web, from data extraction to social media engagement. Within Pipedream, you can leverage these APIs to create powerful, automated workflows that connect with various platforms, including LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram, and more. Phantombuster's API can perform tasks like scraping web pages, automating social media interactions, and extracting useful data without manual input, which can be combined with other Pipedream-supported apps for extended functionality.

# Example Use Cases

- **Lead Generation on LinkedIn**: Use Phantombuster's LinkedIn Network Booster to automatically send connection requests and follow-ups. After a lead accepts your request, add their contact info to a Google Sheets spreadsheet using the Google Sheets Pipedream integration for easy tracking and management.

- **Twitter Engagement Automation**: Automate Twitter engagement by setting up a Phantombuster API to auto-like, retweet, or follow based on specific hashtags or keywords. Then, use Pipedream to connect to Slack and send notifications when thereâ€™s engagement, like a new follower or mention, to keep your team updated in real time.

- **Instagram Profile Scraper**: Scrape Instagram profile details using Phantombuster and build a workflow in Pipedream that sends the data to Airtable. This can be used to monitor competitors, track influencers, or gather market research by maintaining an up-to-date database of key Instagram metrics in Airtable.
