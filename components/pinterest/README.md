# Overview

The Pinterest API on Pipedream allows you to interact with Pinterest programmatically, enabling the creation and management of boards, pins, and advertisements. With Pipedream's serverless platform, you can automate workflows, integrate Pinterest with other apps, and build custom actions based on triggers like new pins or comments. Pipedream's no-code interface coupled with code steps offers flexibility for both non-coders and developers to build complex integrations.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate Pin Creation**: Trigger a workflow whenever you upload a new image to Dropbox or Google Drive, automatically creating a new pin on a specified Pinterest board with that image.

- **Monitor Pinterest Engagement**: Set up a workflow to track comments and saves on your pins. Whenever there's a new comment or a pin is saved, Pipedream can send a notification to your Slack channel or email inbox, helping you stay engaged with your audience.

- **Sync Pinterest Activities with a CRM**: Whenever a new pin is created on your Pinterest account, use Pipedream to add or update the information about the pin in your CRM, like Salesforce or HubSpot, keeping your customer interaction data up to date.
