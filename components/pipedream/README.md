# Overview

The Pipedream API unlocks powerful programmatic control over your workflows and integrations on Pipedream. By leveraging this API, you can create, modify, and deploy workflows, manage sources and destinations, and interact with Pipedream's other features programmatically. It's a tool designed to supercharge automation, allowing the development of custom solutions that can respond to events, process data, and connect different services seamlessly.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate CRM Entry**: When a new lead fills out a contact form on your website, use Pipedream to capture the event and invoke the Pipedream API to create a new workflow that adds the lead to your CRM and sends a personalized welcome email via SendGrid.

- **Dynamic ETL Pipeline**: Set up a trigger that monitors a database for changes. Utilize the Pipedream API to dynamically generate workflows that extract the changed data, transform it according to business rules, and load it into a data warehouse like Snowflake.

- **IoT Event Handler**: For IoT devices sending data to a webhook, implement a Pipedream workflow that ingests the data and uses the Pipedream API to route events to different services depending on the device type or sensor reading, such as logging metrics to InfluxDB or sending alerts through Twilio.
