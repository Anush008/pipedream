# Overview

The Pipedream API opens a world of possibilities for automating workflows across various apps and services. It's a powerful tool for developers who need to connect APIs, run serverless code, and manage stateful workflows. By leveraging Pipedream's ability to trigger actions based on events, perform operations using pre-built actions or custom Node.js code, and connect to external apps, you can streamline complex tasks, automate repetitive jobs, and integrate systems effortlessly.

# Example Use Cases

- **Content Moderation Automation**: Connect Pipedream to a social media platform like Twitter via its API. Use sentiment analysis to assess tweets in real-time. If negative sentiment is detected, trigger a workflow that flags the content for review and alerts your moderation team via Slack.

- **E-commerce Order Processing**: Automate order fulfillment by connecting your Shopify store with a fulfillment service like ShipStation. When a new order is received in Shopify, use Pipedream to send the order details to ShipStation, generate a shipping label, and then update the order status back in Shopify.

- **Customer Support Ticket Routing**: Integrate Pipedream with Zendesk and a CRM like Salesforce. When a new support ticket is created in Zendesk, Pipedream's workflow can categorize the ticket based on keyword analysis, retrieve customer data from Salesforce, and assign the ticket to the appropriate team or agent.
