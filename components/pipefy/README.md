# Overview

The Pipefy API on Pipedream allows you to automate workflows and integrate with the Pipefy platform, a tool designed for managing processes and workflows. With this API, you can create, update, and manage cards, phases, and fields within your Pipefy account. It's a powerful way to connect Pipefy to hundreds of other apps, set up event-driven workflows, and streamline processes such as task assignment, data collection, and project management.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate Task Assignment**: When a new form submission is received in Typeform, you can use Pipedream to automatically create a card in a specific phase in Pipefy, assigning it to the relevant team member. This streamlines the process of capturing leads or feedback and ensuring they're actioned promptly.

- **Sync Project Management Tools**: If you're using Trello for project management but managing tasks within Pipefy, you can set up a workflow on Pipedream to sync new Trello cards to Pipefy. Whenever a card is added to a Trello list, a corresponding Pipefy card is created, ensuring all your project information is up-to-date across platforms.

- **Streamlined Reporting**: Integrate Pipefy with Google Sheets using Pipedream to automatically add new card details to a spreadsheet. This can be used for reporting on project status, resource allocation, or task completion, providing a real-time overview without manual data entry.
