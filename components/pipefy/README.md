# Overview

The Pipefy API unlocks the ability to manage and automate workflows within the Pipefy platform through Pipedream. By integrating with this API, you can create, update, and retrieve cards, phases, and fields, manage user roles, and automate processes between Pipefy and other apps. Leveraging the Pipedream platform, you can build real-time, event-driven workflows without the need for server infrastructure, tapping into hundreds of pre-built connectors or using HTTP / Webhook triggers to link Pipefy with other services.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate Task Creation**: When a new sale is recorded in your CRM, automatically create a card in Pipefy's sales pipeline, ensuring that your sales process kicks off without delay.

- **Sync Customer Support Requests**: Create a workflow where new support tickets from a tool like Zendesk automatically generate a card in Pipefy, allowing your support team to track and resolve issues within their preferred workflow management tool.

- **Streamline Employee Onboarding**: When a new employee is added to your HR system, like BambooHR, automatically create an onboarding checklist in Pipefy to streamline the process and ensure no step is missed.
