Pipedreamâ€™s low-code environment empowers you to create complex workflows by connecting Pizzly-authenticated APIs with other Pipedream-supported services.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Data Syncing Between CRMs**: Use Pizzly to authenticate to CRM platforms like HubSpot or Salesforce, then set up a Pipedream workflow to sync contact information between them in real-time. This can ensure that your sales teams across different divisions have the same data without manual updates.

- **Social Media Management Automation**: With Pizzly handling the authentication, you can build a Pipedream workflow to automate social media postings across platforms like Twitter, LinkedIn, and Facebook. When a new blog post is published on your CMS, trigger a flow that shares this content across your social accounts, keeping your audience engaged without manual effort.

- **Consolidated Analytics Reporting**: Connect Pizzly to various analytics services like Google Analytics and Mixpanel. Use Pipedream to orchestrate a workflow that collects key metrics from each service, consolidates the data, and generates a comprehensive report delivered to your email or a Slack channel on a daily or weekly schedule.
