# Overview

The Plaid API provides robust financial data services, allowing you to connect user bank accounts to your app, retrieve account transactions, monitor for account changes, and verify account ownership. On Pipedream, you can leverage these capabilities to create powerful, serverless workflows that react to a variety of financial events, aggregate and analyze financial data, or integrate with other apps to streamline finance-related processes.

# Example Use Cases

- **Transaction Monitoring and Alerts**: Build a workflow that triggers whenever new transactions are detected in a user's bank account. Use this to send real-time alerts via email or SMS, or log the transactions to a Google Sheet for easy monitoring and analysis.

- **Expense Tracking and Categorization**: Develop an automatic expense tracker by triggering a workflow on each transaction. Using Pipedream's built-in code steps, categorize transactions by type, vendor, or custom rules, then push this categorized data into accounting software like QuickBooks for simplified bookkeeping.

- **Account Verification for Payment Processing**: Set up a workflow that uses Plaid's account verification capabilities to streamline onboarding for payment processing. Once a user's account is linked and verified, use Pipedream to connect to payment gateways like Stripe to initiate payments or manage subscriptions.
