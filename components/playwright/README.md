# Overview

The Playwright API on Pipedream unlocks the potential for powerful web automation and testing. With Playwright, you can programmatically interact with websites, performing tasks like browser automation, scraping content, and automated testing of web applications. By leveraging Pipedream's serverless platform, you can orchestrate these capabilities with other apps and services, creating robust, automated workflows.

# Example Use Cases

- **Scheduled Content Scraping**: Use Playwright within a Pipedream workflow to scrape website content on a daily schedule. Extract data like stock prices, news headlines, or product information and store it in Google Sheets for analysis or report generation.

- **Social Media Monitoring**: Create a Pipedream workflow that utilizes Playwright to log into social media accounts, check for specific updates or mentions, and then use Twilio to send SMS alerts for immediate action or notifications.
