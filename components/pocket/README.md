# Overview

The Pocket API allows users to interact programmatically with their Pocket account, a service for saving web pages and articles to read later. By using Pocket's API on Pipedream, you can automate content curation, archiving, and sharing workflows. With Pipedream's serverless platform, you can seamlessly integrate Pocket with other services, trigger actions based on new saved items, and manipulate your Pocket list with custom automation logic without writing extensive code.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate Content Tagging in Pocket**: Whenever you save a new article to Pocket, automatically analyze its content using a natural language processing service like Algorithmia, and then update the article in Pocket with relevant tags for easier categorization and retrieval.

- **Daily Digest Email of New Pocket Items**: Collect all articles saved to Pocket in the last 24 hours and send a daily digest to your email using SendGrid. This keeps you informed about your saved articles and ensures you never miss out on reading what you've saved.

- **Sync Saved Articles to Notion**: Create a workflow that triggers whenever you add a new item to Pocket. Use the Notion API to add a reference to this item in a specified Notion database, allowing you to manage your reading list within your broader note-taking or project management setup.
