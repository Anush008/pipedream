# Overview

The Podio API allows you to interact with the Podio platform to manage workspaces, tasks, projects, and collaboration. On Pipedream, you can harness these capabilities to craft automated workflows that react to events in Podio or connect Podio to hundreds of other services. Pipedream's serverless platform lets you run code that integrates the Podio API without provisioning servers, enabling tasks like syncing data between apps, automating project updates, and processing forms.

# Example Use Cases

- **Task Automation Across Apps**: Connect Podio to Trello using Pipedream to create cards in Trello whenever new tasks are added in Podio. This workflow ensures task visibility across different project management tools and keeps your teams in sync.

- **Lead Capture to CRM**: Capture leads from a Podio web form and automatically save them into a CRM like Salesforce. Every time a new form is submitted in Podio, Pipedream can push that data into Salesforce, keeping your sales pipeline up-to-date with no manual entry required.

- **Project Management Dashboard Updates**: Utilize Pipedream to integrate Podio with a dashboard tool like Google Data Studio. Whenever projects in Podio reach a new milestone, Pipedream can trigger an update to a Google Data Studio report, providing real-time project analytics to stakeholders.
