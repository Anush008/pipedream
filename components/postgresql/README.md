# Overview

The PostgreSQL API on Pipedream allows you to interact with your PostgreSQL databases directly within your workflows. This powerful integration can be used to automate database operations, synchronize data across different systems, and trigger actions based on database events. With Pipedream's serverless platform, you can create workflows that respond to HTTP requests, process data, and use SQL queries to read or write to your PostgreSQL instance.

# Example Use Cases

- **Data Synchronization**: Sync data from PostgreSQL to a CRM like Salesforce or HubSpot. When a new row is inserted into a PostgreSQL table, use Pipedream to automatically create or update a corresponding record in your CRM.
- **Real-time Analytics**: Trigger a workflow whenever there's a new entry in your database, processing and pushing the data to analytics tools such as Google Analytics or Mixpanel. You can keep your dashboards updated in real-time without manual intervention.
- **Automated Backups**: Set up a schedule to back up certain tables or databases. Pipedream can execute a workflow that dumps your PostgreSQL data and stores it in cloud storage solutions like AWS S3, ensuring you have regular, automated backups.

# Example Workflows

- **Automated Database Cleanup**: Automatically delete rows from a PostgreSQL table based on a specific condition, such as rows older than a certain date. This helps keep your database lean and can improve performance.

- **Dynamic Reporting System**: Generate and email reports based on PostgreSQL data on a regular schedule. This workflow can compile data, create a report, and send it to stakeholders without manual effort.

- **Order Processing Automation**: Integrate PostgreSQL with an e-commerce platform like Shopify. When a new order is placed, insert the order details into your database and trigger inventory updates or post-sale customer communication.
