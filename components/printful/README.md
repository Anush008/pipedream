# Overview

The Printful API allows you to integrate on-demand printing and warehousing into your own app or business. With this API, you can create new orders, retrieve information about items, and sync your products. In Pipedream, you can build complex workflows that trigger from various events, automate order processing, synchronize inventory with your store, or even respond to customer actions.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate Order Fulfillment**: When a new order is placed in your e-commerce platform, use a Pipedream workflow to automatically send the order details to Printful for fulfillment. This can cut the manual effort and speed up the delivery process.

- **Sync Product Inventory**: Keep your store's inventory up-to-date by creating a workflow that periodically checks inventory levels at Printful and updates the quantities on your storefront accordingly. This ensures that your customers see the correct available stock.

- **Handle Order Updates**: Set up a workflow that listens for webhooks from Printful for order status updates. Use this to notify customers with real-time updates via email or SMS, or to update the order status in your database.
