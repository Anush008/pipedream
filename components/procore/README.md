# Overview

Leverage the Procore API to streamline construction management by automating data sync, enhancing project tracking, and connecting to other business tools within Pipedream's serverless platform. With Procore's endpoints, you can manage project information, access financial data, track labor productivity, and more. Build workflows that trigger on Procore events or schedule them to run on your own cadence, creating a seamless integration between Procore and your preferred software stack.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Project Reports**: Send daily project status reports to stakeholders by aggregating data from Procore, such as project progress, budget details, and resource allocations. Use scheduled Pipedream workflows to fetch the data and compile it into reports, then distribute them via email or messaging apps like Slack.

- **Real-Time Incident Reporting**: Enhance safety response by triggering a Pipedream workflow every time an incident is reported in Procore. The workflow can log the incident details in a centralized safety tracking system, notify relevant personnel via SMS or push notifications, and create follow-up tasks in project management tools like Asana or JIRA.

- **Sync Financials with Accounting Software**: Keep your accounting team in the loop by syncing financial data from Procore to accounting software like QuickBooks or Xero. When a new invoice is created or a payment is made in Procore, trigger a Pipedream workflow to update the corresponding records in your accounting platform, ensuring accurate and up-to-date financial reporting.
