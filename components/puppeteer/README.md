# Overview

The Puppeteer API empowers developers to programmatically control a headless Chrome or Chromium instance via the Pipedream platform. With Puppeteer on Pipedream, you can automate complex browser tasks, perform UI testing, generate pre-rendered content, and scrape web data. The headless browser can mimic human navigation, handle forms, and interact with dynamic content, enabling a vast array of automation possibilities.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Daily Report Generation**: Use Puppeteer to navigate to multiple internal web dashboards, capture and compile screenshots, and then send a daily report email using the SendGrid app on Pipedream. This workflow can keep stakeholders informed with the latest metrics without manual effort.

- **E-commerce Price Monitoring**: Create a workflow with Puppeteer to regularly check product prices on competitorsâ€™ websites. The data can be logged into a Google Sheets document for analysis and historical tracking. If a price drop is detected, trigger an alert or start a price adjustment process within your own e-commerce system.

- **Content Change Detection and Notification**: Set up Puppeteer to monitor changes on a website, such as a competitor's blog or an industry news page. When new content is detected, use Pipedream to trigger a notification to a Slack channel, so your team can stay informed on the latest updates.
