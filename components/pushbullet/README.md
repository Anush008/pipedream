# Overview

The Pushbullet API allows you to connect devices together through simple push notifications, text messaging, and file sharing. It's a versatile API that is particularly useful for sending notifications between devices, sharing links, notes, files, and addressing SMS messages from a computer. With Pipedream, you can integrate Pushbullet into serverless workflows to automate these actions based on various triggers from a plethora of apps, harnessing Pipedream's capacity to connect APIs and services without writing complex code.

# Example Use Cases

- **Instant Error Notifications**: Trigger a Pushbullet notification whenever your website goes down or an error is logged in your server. Use a Pipedream HTTP webhook to receive alerts, and set up an automated process that sends an instant notification to your phone, keeping you updated in real-time.

- **Automated File Sharing Between Teams**: After a file is uploaded to a shared Google Drive folder, automatically send it via Pushbullet to a specific device or user. Combine Google Drive triggers in Pipedream with the Pushbullet API to facilitate seamless file distribution without manual intervention.

- **SMS Messaging Through Web Actions**: Send an SMS message via your phone when a customer submits a form on your website. Pipedream can catch the form submission using a webhook, process the information, and pass it to Pushbullet to send the message, bridging web actions with personal communication channels.
