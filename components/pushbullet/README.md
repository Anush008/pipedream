# Overview

Pushbullet API on Pipedream allows you to automate the process of sending notifications to devices, sharing files, and managing SMS messages. Using Pipedream's serverless platform, you can create workflows that trigger on various events and use Pushbullet to send updates or information to your phone, tablet, or computer. Pipedream offers pre-built actions for Pushbullet, making it easy to integrate its functionalities into your workflows without writing code.

# Example Use Cases

- **Send Alerts for GitHub Repository Events**: Automatically receive Pushbullet notifications for specific events in a GitHub repository like new commits, issues, or pull requests. Combine GitHub's webhook with Pushbullet's API on Pipedream to stay updated on-the-go.

- **Notify on New Email Arrival**: Create a workflow that triggers when you receive a new email in your Gmail inbox and sends a Pushbullet notification with the email's subject and sender. This integration lets you respond to important messages quickly, even if you're not actively checking your inbox.

- **Sync To-Do List Updates**: Whenever a task is added or completed in your Trello board, a workflow can catch this event and push a notification to your devices, keeping you informed about project progress or reminding you of new tasks.
