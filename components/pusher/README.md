# Overview

The Pusher API provides real-time communication capabilities for web and mobile apps. With Pusher on Pipedream, you can build powerful, serverless workflows that react to events with lightning speed. You can leverage Pipedream's seamless integration to trigger actions based on real-time messages, synchronize data across applications, or even automate notifications to users across various platforms.

# Example Use Cases

- **Real-Time Chat Moderation**: Automate the moderation of a chat application by integrating Pusher with sentiment analysis services. When a message is published to a channel, trigger a Pipedream workflow to assess the content and, if necessary, send a command via Pusher to remove the message or flag the user.

- **Synchronized Dashboards**: Keep a business intelligence dashboard updated in real-time. Whenever your database updates, trigger a workflow that processes the data and pushes updates to a Pusher channel, ensuring that all connected dashboards reflect the latest metrics without manual refreshing.

- **IoT Device Alerts**: Use Pusher to send real-time alerts from IoT devices. When a sensor triggers an event, a Pipedream workflow can receive this data, analyze it, and if specific conditions are met, use Pusher to broadcast alerts to a network of subscribers or to another system for further action.
