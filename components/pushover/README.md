# Overview

Pushover is a service that delivers real-time notifications to Android and iOS devices. By tapping into the Pushover API on Pipedream, you can automate the sending of these notifications as part of intricate serverless workflows. This integration enables the creation of custom alerts, reminders, or updates from various trigger events, providing instant communication channels for applications, monitoring systems, and smart home devices.

# Example Use Cases

- **Server Downtime Alert**: Trigger a Pushover notification if a website is down. You could use an HTTP request to check your site's health at regular intervals with Pipedream's cron job feature, and if a check fails, automatically send an alert via Pushover to notify your tech team immediately.

- **Sales Notifications**: Send a Pushover message when a new sale is made. Integrate Pushover with e-commerce platforms like Shopify or WooCommerce on Pipedream. Whenever a new order comes in, capture the event and push a notification to your phone, allowing you to keep track of sales activity in real-time.

- **GitHub Commit Notifications**: Get notified of new commits on a repository. Use Pipedream to listen for `push` events from GitHub. Each time a developer pushes a new commit, the workflow can send a message via Pushover, ensuring that team members are always informed about the latest changes in the codebase.
