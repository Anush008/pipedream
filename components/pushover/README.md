# Overview

The Pushover API on Pipedream allows you to send real-time notifications to Android, iPhone, iPad, and Desktop devices. With Pushoverâ€™s simple API, you can kick off these notifications from a variety of sources, such as messages from webhooks, status updates from monitoring systems, or any other event in your Pipedream workflows that supports HTTP requests. This makes Pushover an excellent app for instant alerting and updating users about critical events or data changes.

# Example Use Cases

- **Incident Alerting with Pushover and PagerDuty**: When a high-priority incident is reported on PagerDuty, trigger a Pipedream workflow to send an immediate notification via Pushover to the on-call engineer. This ensures quick response times to critical issues.

- **Website Downtime Notifications with Pushover and UptimeRobot**: Configure UptimeRobot to send webhooks to Pipedream when your website goes down. The workflow then sends an alert through Pushover to your mobile device, allowing for rapid response to downtime.

- **Daily Sales Summary from Shopify to Pushover**: At the end of each day, compile a summary of sales data from your Shopify store using Pipedream's scheduled workflows. Send a concise report via Pushover to keep stakeholders informed about the day's performance.
