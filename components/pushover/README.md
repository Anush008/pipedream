# Example Use Cases

- **Sales Lead Notifications**: Combine Pushover with a CRM app like Salesforce on Pipedream. Set up a workflow where new leads detected in Salesforce automatically ping your sales team through Pushover, ensuring quick follow-up to capitalize on potential opportunities.

- **Scheduled Reminders**: Use Pipedream's built-in cron job feature to schedule and send daily or weekly reminders via Pushover. It's perfect for keeping your team on track with recurring tasks or deadlines without having to manually manage reminder notifications each time.
