# Overview

Pushover makes it easy to get real-time notifications on your phone, tablet, or desktop. With the Pushover API on Pipedream, you can automate sending these notifications as part of serverless workflows. Trigger actions on Pipedream based on events from various sources, and use the API to inform you instantly. From monitoring website uptime to receiving alerts when a new sale is made, the API is an essential tool for time-sensitive information delivery.

# Example Use Cases

- **Monitor Website Uptime**: Configure an HTTP request to check your website's status at regular intervals. If your site goes down, automatically send a Pushover notification to alert you so that you can take immediate action.
- **Sales Alerts**: Integrate Pushover with an e-commerce platform like Shopify. Whenever a new order is placed, trigger a workflow that sends a notification with the order details, keeping you in the loop on sales activity in real-time.
- **Error Logging**: Combine Pushover with logging tools like Sentry. Set up a workflow to receive immediate notifications when new errors are logged, allowing for rapid response to application issues.
