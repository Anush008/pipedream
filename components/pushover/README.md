# Overview

The Pushover API allows you to send real-time notifications to iOS, Android, and desktop devices. When used in Pipedream workflows, you can automate these notifications based on a wide range of triggers, such as incoming emails, form submissions, or system status changes. Within Pipedream's serverless platform, you can integrate Pushover with various apps to create custom alerting and notification systems. Utilize Pipedream's event sources, actions, and built-in scheduling to react to events or time-based conditions.

# Example Use Cases

- **System Monitor Alerts**: Automatically send a Pushover notification when a server's health check fails. Combine this with a cron-based trigger in Pipedream to regularly monitor system status.

- **E-Commerce Order Notifications**: Send a notification via Pushover when a new order is placed on your Shopify store. Use the Shopify trigger to initiate the workflow and keep tabs on sales activity in real-time.

- **Social Media Mention Alerts**: Get alerted through Pushover whenever your brand is mentioned on Twitter. Set up a workflow with Twitter's streaming API to detect mentions and trigger instant notifications.
