# Overview

The QuickBooks Sandbox API enables you to experiment with QuickBooks Online features in a non-production environment. This gives developers a safe space to build and test applications and workflows without affecting real QuickBooks data. With Pipedream, you can harness this API to create seamless automations and integrate with other apps. Think invoices syncing, expense tracking, and more, all happening in the background, triggered by real-time events.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate Invoice Creation**: Trigger a workflow on Pipedream to create invoices in the QuickBooks Sandbox whenever new orders are received from an e-commerce platform like Shopify. This streamlines the sales process, ensuring that financial records are always synchronized with sales data.

- **Expense Approval Workflow**: Set up a system where expense reports submitted via Slack trigger a Pipedream workflow that creates corresponding expense entries in QuickBooks Sandbox. This adds a layer of convenience for expense tracking and approval without manual data entry.

- **Synchronize Customer Data**: When a new customer is added to a CRM like Salesforce, trigger a workflow on Pipedream to create or update that customer's details in QuickBooks Sandbox. This keeps financial records up to date with the latest customer information, ensuring accurate billing and service.
