# Overview

The Raindrop API offers a suite of tools for managing bookmarks in a highly organized manner. It provides endpoints to create, retrieve, update, and delete bookmarks, as well as manage collections and tags. With Pipedream’s ability to connect APIs and automate workflows, you can harness the power of the Raindrop API to build custom, serverless workflows that react to events and trigger actions across different services. Pipedream also enables you to schedule such workflows or run them in response to HTTP requests.

# Example Use Cases

- **Content Curation Automation**: Automate the process of adding new resources to your Raindrop collections. Whenever a new post is published on a blog you follow, Pipedream can catch the webhook and add the post to a specified collection in Raindrop. This keeps your resources updated without manual intervention.

- **Resource Sharing Workflow**: Share interesting articles from your Raindrop collections to social media platforms. When you tag a bookmark with "share", Pipedream can detect this and post the bookmark’s URL and title to your Twitter account, spreading knowledge with your followers instantly.

- **Daily Digest Email**: Compile a daily digest email of new bookmarks added to a specific Raindrop collection. Pipedream can schedule a workflow to run every day, gather new bookmarks from the collection, and send an email with the list to you or your team, ensuring everyone is on the same page with the latest resources.
