# Overview

RapidAPI is a platform that allows developers to find, connect to, and manage thousands of APIs. With the RapidAPI API on Pipedream, you can automate the process of discovering and interacting with these APIs. You can programmatically search for APIs, subscribe to plans, test endpoints, and track the API usage across your apps. Integrating RapidAPI with Pipedream expands your automation capabilities by allowing you to connect with various APIs for different purposes such as data enrichment, sending notifications, or incorporating machine learning models into your workflows.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated API Discovery and Testing**: Build a workflow that periodically searches for new APIs in a specific category on RapidAPI, tests them for functionality, and sends the results to your email or Slack.

- **Usage Monitoring and Alerting**: Set up a workflow that monitors your API usage statistics on RapidAPI, and if it reaches a certain threshold, automatically triggers alerts or even provisions higher-tier subscriptions to avoid service interruptions.

- **Connecting APIs for Multi-step Workflows**: Create a workflow that uses the RapidAPI API to fetch data from multiple APIs, perform transformations or analyses, and then stores the results in a Google Sheet or sends them to another service like Airtable for further processing.
