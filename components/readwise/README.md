# Overview

The Readwise API offers a gateway to interact programmatically with your Readwise account, enabling you to access your highlights, manage them, and integrate your reading insights into other applications and services. With Pipedream, you can craft workflows that react to new highlights, automate organization, or even sync your reading data with other apps for further analysis or sharing.

# Example Use Cases

- **Sync Highlights to a Google Sheet**: Use Pipedream to trigger a workflow whenever you add new highlights in Readwise. Automatically append these highlights to a Google Sheet for archival, analysis, or sharing with a team. This can be particularly useful for research purposes or collaborative review of key insights from literature.

- **Daily Email Digest of New Highlights**: Configure Pipedream to send a daily email digest with all new highlights collected in Readwise from the previous day. This workflow keeps you engaged with your reading material and ensures that important highlights don't get lost in the shuffle.

- **Create Trello Cards from Book Highlights**: With each new highlight you make in Readwise, trigger a Pipedream workflow to create a Trello card. Organize your reading insights for projects, reference materials, or study notes. This can be incredibly useful for project managers, researchers, or students who want actionable items stemming from their reading.
