# Overview

The RingCentral API bridges your communication needs with automation, allowing you to integrate voice calls, SMS, and team messaging with Pipedream's serverless platform. On Pipedream, you can create workflows that trigger on specific RingCentral events or schedule automated tasks that execute RingCentral actions, such as sending messages or making calls. This flexibility opens up a myriad of possibilities to streamline business communications, coordinate with teams, and connect with customers more effectively.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Support Ticket Alerts**: Trigger a workflow when a new support ticket is logged in your helpdesk system (e.g., Zendesk). Automatically send a message to the assigned support team's RingCentral chat, ensuring they are immediately aware of critical issues.

- **Missed Call Follow-ups**: Set up a workflow that listens for missed call events on RingCentral. When a call is missed, automatically send a follow-up SMS to the caller or create a task in a CRM like Salesforce, ensuring no lead goes unattended.

- **Meeting Reminder Bot**: Schedule a daily workflow that retrieves the day's calendar events from Google Calendar and sends reminders via RingCentral SMS to all participants an hour before each meeting starts, reducing no-shows and improving meeting preparedness.
