# Overview

The Rocket Chat API opens the door to automating and extending the capabilities of the Rocket Chat platform. By leveraging this API in Pipedream, you can create powerful workflows that trigger on new messages, manage users, send messages, or even automate administrative tasks. Pipedream's serverless platform makes it easy to connect Rocket Chat with hundreds of other apps, enabling the orchestration of complex workflows without the need for dedicated infrastructure.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Welcome Messages**: When a new user joins a channel, use the Rocket Chat API to trigger a Pipedream workflow that sends a personalized welcome message from a bot account. This can help in onboarding new members and providing them with useful information right off the bat.

- **Real-time Alerts from Other Apps**: Integrate Rocket Chat with monitoring tools like Datadog or New Relic on Pipedream. Set up a workflow that listens for alerts from these tools and posts them to a designated channel in Rocket Chat, ensuring that the team is immediately notified of potential issues or system updates.

- **Scheduled Reports and Summaries**: Combine the Rocket Chat API with a scheduling tool like Google Calendar. Configure a Pipedream workflow to fetch data from sales or project management apps at a regular interval, then compile and post a summary report to a Rocket Chat channel, keeping the team aligned with the latest metrics and progress.
