# Overview

The Salesforce (REST API) provides a powerful platform for creating and managing customer relationships with a wide array of features like data manipulation, querying, and complex automation. With Pipedream's serverless execution, you can create workflows that automate your sales processes, sync data with other platforms, enhance customer engagement, and trigger actions based on specific events. Dive into Salesforce data, streamline lead management, track customer interactions, and push or pull data to or from Salesforce seamlessly.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate Lead Scoring**: Trigger a Pipedream workflow whenever a new lead is created in Salesforce. The workflow can evaluate the lead quality using predefined criteria, update the lead score in Salesforce, and, if the score is high enough, notify the sales team via Slack or email.

- **Sync Salesforce Data with Google Sheets**: Keep sales data in sync by using a workflow that runs on a schedule. It can fetch new and updated records from Salesforce and push them to a Google Sheets spreadsheet. This can be used to maintain live reports or share data with team members who don't have direct access to Salesforce.

- **Customer Onboarding Sequence**: When a new opportunity is won in Salesforce, trigger a workflow that kicks off a customer onboarding sequence. This could involve creating tasks in project management tools like Asana, sending a welcome email sequence via SendGrid, and enrolling the customer in a specified nurture track in a marketing platform like Mailchimp.
