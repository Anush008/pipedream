# Overview

The Twilio SendGrid API on Pipedream enables you to automate the sending of emails, manage contacts, and track email events like opens and clicks. With Pipedream's serverless platform, you can create workflows that trigger on various events and connect SendGrid with other apps to design customized email automation solutions.

# Example Use Cases

- **Transactional Email Automation**: Send order confirmations, shipping notices, or password resets automatically by triggering a SendGrid email for each new row added to a Google Sheets spreadsheet or a new Stripe charge.

- **Email Campaign Analytics**: Keep tabs on your email campaign performance by capturing SendGrid email event webhooks in Pipedream, then log these events to Amazon S3 or send them to a real-time dashboard like Geckoboard for analysis.

- **Contact List Management**: Automatically update your SendGrid contact lists when users sign up on your website, using a webhook to trigger the workflow. Integrate with Airtable or Google Contacts to sync contact information across platforms seamlessly.
