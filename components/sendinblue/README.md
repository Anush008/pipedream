# Overview

SendinBlue's API allows you to automate email campaigns, manage contacts, send transactional emails, and leverage SMS messaging. Using Pipedream, you can create workflows that trigger on various events and use SendinBlue to engage with your audience seamlessly. Integrate SendinBlue with other apps to personalize your marketing, react to user behavior, and manage subscriber data in real-time.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Welcome Email Series**: Set up a workflow where new subscribers added to a specific list in SendinBlue trigger a series of welcome emails. These can be staggered to send over the first few days or weeks of their subscription, ensuring sustained engagement.

- **E-Commerce Cart Abandonment Reminders**: Combine SendinBlue with an e-commerce platform like Shopify. When a user abandons their cart, trigger an email through SendinBlue to remind them of their incomplete purchase and perhaps offer a discount to encourage completion.

- **SMS Notifications for Critical Alerts**: Integrate SendinBlue's SMS capabilities with a monitoring tool like Datadog. When a critical alert is triggered, use SendinBlue to send an SMS to the relevant team member, ensuring immediate attention to urgent issues.
