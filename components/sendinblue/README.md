# Overview

SendinBlue API on Pipedream allows you to automate email marketing, transactional emails, and SMS messages. With this API, you can manage contacts, send targeted campaigns, track email open and click rates, and create custom marketing workflows. The power of Pipedream lies in its ability to connect SendinBlue with a multitude of other services, enabling the automation of complex tasks through serverless workflows.

# Example Use Cases

- **Sync New E-commerce Customers to SendinBlue Contacts**: When a new customer signs up on your e-commerce platform (like Shopify), trigger a Pipedream workflow that automatically adds them to a SendinBlue contact list for future marketing and engagement campaigns.

- **Automated Lead Scoring and Segmentation**: Combine SendinBlue with a CRM like Salesforce. Use Pipedream to listen for new leads or contact updates in Salesforce, then update or create a corresponding contact in SendinBlue with a custom attribute reflecting their lead score, thus segmenting them for targeted follow-up campaigns.

- **Real-time Notifications of Campaign Performance**: After sending a marketing campaign through SendinBlue, use Pipedream to monitor open and click data. Then, send a Slack message to your marketing team's channel with real-time performance updates, or log the data in a Google Sheet for further analysis.
