# Overview

The SendinBlue API on Pipedream allows you to automate email and SMS marketing campaigns, manage contacts, send transactional emails, and track campaign performance. By leveraging Pipedream's capabilities, you can create event-driven workflows that respond to various triggers, such as webhooks, emails, or scheduled events, to connect SendinBlue with other services and automate tasks.

# Example Use Cases

- **Sync New Subscribers to CRM**: Whenever a new subscriber is added to a SendinBlue list, automatically add them to your CRM (like Salesforce or HubSpot). This keeps your sales team in sync with the latest leads or subscribers without manual data entry.

- **Automated Welcome Email Sequence**: Trigger a sequence of personalized welcome emails through SendinBlue when a new user signs up on your platform. You can use Pipedream to capture sign-up events, and then use SendinBlue's transactional email service to send out the emails on a schedule you set.

- **Real-time Notifications for Campaign Performance**: Get Slack notifications for real-time updates on email campaign performance. Set up a Pipedream workflow that listens for SendinBlue webhook events on email opens, clicks, or bounces, and then posts summaries or alerts to a designated Slack channel.
