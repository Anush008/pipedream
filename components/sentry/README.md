# Overview

The Sentry API provides programmatic access to Sentry's application monitoring platform, allowing you to automate responses to issues, manage releases, and integrate issue tracking with your existing tools. On Pipedream, you can tap into this API to craft workflows that respond in real-time to events in Sentry, such as new issues or performance alerts. By linking Sentry with other apps available on Pipedream, such as Slack, GitHub, or Jira, you can streamline your development workflow, ensuring faster resolution times and better communication across your development team.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate Slack Notifications for New Sentry Issues**: Trigger a Pipedream workflow whenever a new issue is reported in Sentry. Use the Sentry API to retrieve details about the issue, and then send a notification to a designated Slack channel with the issue's specifics. This keeps your team informed and ready to react swiftly to new errors.

- **Create GitHub Issues from Sentry Events**: Set up a Pipedream workflow that starts when a new error is tracked in Sentry. The workflow can automatically create a GitHub issue for the error, including all relevant details needed for resolution. This integration helps ensure that bugs are logged in your version control system for prioritization and fixing.

- **Sync Sentry Releases with Jira**: Whenever a new release is created in Sentry, a Pipedream workflow can be triggered to update your Jira tickets with release notes. This workflow can also transition the Jira ticket to a "Released" status, keeping your project management tool in sync with your code deployments and error monitoring.
