# Overview

The ServiceNow API enables developers to tap into the robust capabilities of ServiceNow's IT service management platform. With the API, you can create, read, update, and delete records, manage workflows, and integrate with other services. By leveraging these capabilities, you can automate routine tasks, sync data across multiple platforms, and enhance operational efficiencies.

# Example Use Cases

- **Incident Management Automation**: Automatically create incidents in ServiceNow when critical alerts are triggered in monitoring tools like Datadog or New Relic. This ensures timely attention to potential issues and streamlines the incident response process.

- **HR Onboarding Workflow**: When a new employee is added to an HR system like Workday, trigger a workflow in Pipedream that creates a new user account in ServiceNow, assigns the necessary roles, and initiates onboarding tasks. This can significantly cut the time needed to get a new team member up and running.

- **Customer Support Ticket Sync**: Synchronize customer support tickets between ServiceNow and a CRM platform like Salesforce. When a ticket is updated in ServiceNow, automatically reflect those changes in Salesforce to keep all teams aligned and informed about customer issues, ensuring a unified approach to customer service.
