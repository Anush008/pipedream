# Overview

The ShipStation API unlocks the ability to streamline e-commerce shipping, allowing you to automate order processing, label creation, and shipment tracking. With Pipedream, you can trigger workflows on various ShipStation events, sync shipment details with other apps, and handle post-purchase operations with ease. By leveraging Pipedream's serverless platform, you can integrate ShipStation with other services, manipulate data, and trigger actions conditionally without the need to maintain infrastructure.

# Example Use Cases

- **Order Fulfillment Automation**: When a new order comes in ShipStation, automatically fulfill it by generating a shipping label and sending it to the customer. Integrate with messaging apps like Slack to notify your team of the new order and follow the fulfillment process.

- **Inventory Management**: Sync your ShipStation orders with an inventory management system like Airtable or Google Sheets to keep your stock levels updated in real-time. Use this workflow to trigger restock alerts or updates to your e-commerce platform when inventory levels change.

- **Customer Follow-Up Campaigns**: After an order is marked as shipped in ShipStation, use Pipedream to trigger a sequence of personalized follow-up emails to the customer via SendGrid. This can enhance customer satisfaction and encourage reviews or repeat purchases.
