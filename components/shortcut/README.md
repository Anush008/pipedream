# Overview

The Shortcut API integrates with Pipedream, enabling the automation of project management tasks and the streamlining of software development workflows. Leverage the API to create stories, manage tasks, and track progress within Shortcut, all through Pipedream's serverless platform. With the Shortcut API on Pipedream, you can trigger workflows from Shortcut events, manipulate Shortcut resources, and connect with numerous other apps for a fully automated, cross-functional project management experience.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Task Creation on New GitHub Push**: When a developer pushes changes to a specified branch in GitHub, a workflow is triggered in Pipedream that automatically creates a new story or task in Shortcut, linking back to the commit. This ensures that code changes are tracked against project tasks without manual intervention.

- **Slack Notifications for Shortcut Project Updates**: Configure a Pipedream workflow that sends custom notifications to a Slack channel whenever there is an update on tasks within a Shortcut project. This could include status changes, new comments, or the completion of tasks, keeping the team informed in real-time.

- **Syncing Shortcut Milestones with Google Calendar**: Use Pipedream to create a workflow that adds new milestones created in Shortcut as events in a Google Calendar. This can help with visibility across teams who need to keep track of project timelines and important dates outside of Shortcut's environment.
