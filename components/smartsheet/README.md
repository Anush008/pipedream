# Overview

The Smartsheet API on Pipedream allows for seamless integration and automation of your spreadsheet and project management tasks. With this API, you can create, update, delete, and read sheets, rows, columns, and attachments. It simplifies the synchronization of data between Smartsheet and other services, triggering workflows on data changes, and performing batch operations to enhance productivity.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate Project Task Creation**: When a new ticket is created in your project management tool, such as Jira, use Pipedream to automatically create a corresponding task in a Smartsheet project sheet, ensuring project tracking is always up-to-date.

- **Sync Contacts with CRM**: Keep your CRM platform, like Salesforce, in sync with Smartsheet by using Pipedream to create or update contacts in Salesforce whenever a new row is added to a Smartsheet containing contact information.

- **Aggregate Social Media Metrics**: Collect and consolidate social media data into a Smartsheet report by setting up a Pipedream workflow that fetches metrics from various platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram at regular intervals.
