# Overview

The Samsung SmartThings API lets you connect and automate your smart home devices. With Pipedream, you can harness this API to create custom workflows that interact with your gadgets, respond to events, and orchestrate devices to work together seamlessly. Trigger actions based on sensor readings, automate lighting, or even secure your home with custom routines that fit your life like a glove.

# Example Use Cases

- **Smart Security Alerts**: Send an alert to your phone or email when your SmartThings motion sensor detects unexpected movement. Combine this with facial recognition software to determine if the movement is from a stranger or a known person.

- **Energy Saving Mode**: Automatically turn off lights and set thermostats to eco-mode when your SmartThings presence sensors indicate no one is home. Integrate with weather services to adjust settings based on the exterior environment for maximum energy efficiency.

- **Routine Starters**: Kick off your morning or evening routine by controlling multiple devices with a single command. Have your coffee maker start brewing, play your favorite playlist, and gradually brighten lights at a set time or when your alarm goes off.
