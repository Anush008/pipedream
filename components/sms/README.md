# Overview

The SMS API on Pipedream allows you to send and manage text messages programmatically. With this capability, you can craft workflows that automate communication with customers, alert staff in real-time, or integrate SMS notifications into your existing systems. By leveraging Pipedream's robust platform, you can trigger SMS actions based on a variety of events from different services, streamlining processes that depend on quick and reliable messaging.

# Example Use Cases

- **Customer Appointment Reminders**: Streamline the process of reminding customers about their appointments. Connect the SMS API with a calendar service like Google Calendar. When a scheduled appointment is approaching, the workflow triggers an SMS reminder to the customer, reducing no-shows.

- **Real-time Stock Alerts**: Create a workflow that monitors stock prices using a financial data source, such as the Yahoo Finance API. When a stock hits a specific threshold, an SMS alert is sent to subscribers, allowing them to make timely investment decisions.

- **Order Confirmation and Shipping Updates**: Improve e-commerce experiences by integrating the SMS API with Shopify. Automatically send an order confirmation text after a purchase and follow-up with shipping updates, keeping customers informed every step of the way.
