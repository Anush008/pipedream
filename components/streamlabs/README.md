# Overview

Streamlabs offers a suite of tools that enhances live streaming experiences for both streamers and viewers. With their API, you can automate alerts, manage donations, and interact with different parts of the Streamlabs ecosystem programmatically. On Pipedream, you can harness this functionality to create custom workflows, integrating Streamlabs with various other apps and services to streamline your streaming setup or engage with your audience in innovative ways.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate Donation Thank You Messages**: Set up a workflow on Pipedream that triggers whenever you receive a new donation via Streamlabs. It can automatically post a personalized thank you message in your Discord server or Twitch chat, acknowledging your supporters in real-time.

- **Streamline Alerts for New Followers and Subscribers**: Create a workflow that listens for new followers or subscribers through the Streamlabs API. Then, use it to update a Google Sheet with the details of each new follower, or push notifications to your phone so you can keep track of your growing community on-the-go.

- **Intelligent Scene Switching**: Build a Pipedream workflow that uses the Twitch API to monitor your stream's chat for specific keywords. When a keyword is detected, the workflow can send a command to Streamlabs to change the scene or activate an overlay, adding a layer of interaction to your stream as viewers trigger visual effects or on-screen events.
