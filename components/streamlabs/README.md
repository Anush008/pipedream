# Overview

The Streamlabs API enables developers to interact programmatically with the Streamlabs suite of tools, primarily focused on live streaming notifications and alerts. With this API on Pipedream, you can automate processes that enhance your live streaming experience, such as triggering real-time alerts, updating overlays, and managing donations. Pipedream's serverless platform allows you to connect Streamlabs with hundreds of other apps without writing complex code, making it easier to create custom integrations and workflows.

# Example Use Cases

- **Real-time Donor Acknowledgment**: Use the Streamlabs API to detect new donations and automatically send a personalized thank you message via Twilio's SMS or email.

- **Dynamic Overlay Updates**: Keep your viewers engaged by updating your stream's overlay in real-time when specific events occur, like gaining a new follower or receiving a donation, by modifying the Streamlabs overlay settings.

- **Automated Social Media Updates**: Share your streaming milestones automatically (e.g., number of live viewers, donations received) on social media platforms like Twitter to keep your audience informed and engaged even when they're not watching the stream.
