# Overview

The Stripe API opens a world of possibilities for e-commerce, subscription services, and payment processing within apps. With Pipedream, you can harness this power to automate workflows, sync data across platforms, and respond to events in real time. Whether you're managing invoices, tracking customers, or handling complex billing operations, integrating Stripe with Pipedream simplifies these tasks by connecting to other apps, setting up triggers, and orchestrating serverless workflows.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate Invoice Creation and Delivery**: When a new order is received in your e-commerce platform, automatically create an invoice in Stripe, and then send the invoice to the customer via email using SendGrid, all orchestrated within a Pipedream workflow.

- **Sync New Customers to CRM**: Keep your CRM updated by using Pipedream to detect new customer creations in Stripe. When a new customer is added, the workflow can add or update their record in your CRM, like Salesforce, ensuring sales teams have the most current information without manual entry.

- **Real-time Fraud Alerting**: Monitor transactions in Stripe for potential fraud. Use Pipedream to analyze payment patterns and flag high-risk transactions. Connect with Slack or Twilio to send instant alerts to your team, enabling them to take immediate action to protect your business.
