# Overview

With the Stripe API, you can create powerful payment processing systems within Pipedream's serverless platform. This API allows you to manage billing, set up recurring subscriptions, verify transactions, and handle complex workflows involving payments. Integrating Stripe with Pipedream unlocks the ability to automate notifications, synchronize customer data across platforms, trigger actions based on payment events, and much more, all in real-time.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Invoice Processing**: Trigger a workflow in Pipedream whenever a new invoice is created in Stripe. Validate the payment, send a customized receipt to the customer, and log the sale in an accounting software like QuickBooks.

- **Customer Subscription Lifecycle Management**: Monitor subscription status changes in Stripe. Automatically update the customerâ€™s access in your service when they subscribe, upgrade, downgrade, or cancel. Send personalized emails based on their subscription status, using an email service like SendGrid.

- **Fraud Detection and Alerts**: Use Stripe's Radar features to detect potential fraud. Set up a Pipedream workflow that gets triggered by Stripe's fraud detection events. Connect to a Slack channel to alert your team in real-time for review and potential action.
