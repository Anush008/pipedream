# Overview

The Tally API enables streamlined interaction with Tally forms, offering a suite of functionalities to automate form submissions, analyze responses, and integrate with other services. By linking Tally with Pipedream, you can create workflows that trigger actions based on form submissions, synchronize data across platforms, and push form insights to team communication channels, CRMs, or databases, optimizing the way you gather and utilize user feedback or survey data.

# Example Use Cases

- **Auto-Response Emails After Form Submission**: When a user submits a form on Tally, trigger an email autoresponder using Pipedream's Email by Zapier app. This workflow can send a thank-you message, provide additional resources, or offer confirmation of submission, enhancing the user experience.

- **Sync Form Submissions to Google Sheets**: With each Tally form submission, automatically append the data to a Google Sheet using the Google Sheets app on Pipedream. This workflow is ideal for maintaining organized records of responses, facilitating easy data analysis and reporting for team collaboration and decision-making.

- **Slack Notifications for New Form Entries**: Configure a Pipedream workflow to post a message to a specific Slack channel using the Slack app whenever a new form submission is received on Tally. This use case keeps teams instantly informed about new entries, ensuring prompt follow-up actions and maintaining team alignment on feedback or lead captures.
