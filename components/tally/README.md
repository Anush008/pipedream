# Overview

Tally is a form builder that lets you craft forms with ease, collecting responses from users. With the Tally API on Pipedream, you can automate interactions with your Tally forms, such as retrieving responses, updating forms, or triggering actions in other apps when a new response is submitted. Itâ€™s a powerful way to integrate form submissions into your data pipelines, connect them to your CRM, or create notifications for new responses.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Response Collection and Analysis**: Use the Tally API on Pipedream to fetch new form responses periodically and send them to Google Sheets. Analyze the data with Google's powerful tools or share it with your team for collaborative insights.

- **Dynamic CRM Updates**: Create a workflow that listens for new Tally form submissions and uses the Tally API to extract that data. Then, update or create contacts in a CRM like Salesforce, ensuring that your customer information is always current.

- **Instant Notification System**: Set up a Pipedream workflow that triggers on new form responses from Tally to send notifications. These could be Slack messages to your team, emails via SendGrid, or SMS messages through Twilio, providing immediate updates on form activity.
