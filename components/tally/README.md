# Overview

Tally's API lets you craft workflows for seamless data management and interaction with Tally forms. With Pipedream, you can automate actions based on form submissions, orchestrate data flows, and connect Tally to hundreds of other apps. Create dynamic forms, analyze submissions, and trigger events in other services like CRMs, databases, or communication platforms. Pipedreamâ€™s serverless platform empowers you to build, modify, and scale these integrations with minimal fuss.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate Contact Collection to CRM**: When a new Tally form submission includes contact info, Pipedream can automatically add or update the contact details in a CRM like Salesforce, keeping your lead database fresh and up-to-date.

- **Feedback Analysis and Notification**: Analyze feedback from Tally form submissions in real-time. Use Pipedream to send sentiment analysis to a Google Sheet and trigger an alert via Slack or email if a response requires immediate attention.

- **Event Registration and Calendar Integration**: Use Pipedream to streamline event sign-ups. When someone registers through a Tally form, Pipedream can create a new event in a Google Calendar and send a customized confirmation email to the participant.
