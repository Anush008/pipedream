# Overview

Tally is a form builder that lets you craft forms quickly and integrate them with various services. With the Tally API on Pipedream, you can automate form submission handling, synchronize responses with your database, or trigger actions across different apps. Pipedream's serverless platform facilitates these automations by connecting Tally to hundreds of other services without managing infrastructure.

# Example Use Cases

- **Auto-Respond to Submissions**: Trigger an email to the form submitter using the SendGrid app on Pipedream. Whenever a new Tally submission is detected, parse the content and send a tailored email thanking them for their input or providing further instructions.

- **Sync Form Responses to Google Sheets**: Archive every Tally form response to a Google Sheet for easy sharing and analysis. This workflow can be set up to ensure that whenever a new submission is received, it's automatically added to a specified Google Sheet, keeping all team members up-to-date.

- **Slack Notifications for New Responses**: Get instant notifications in a Slack channel when a Tally form is submitted. Set up a Pipedream workflow that listens for new Tally submissions and posts a summary or the entire response to a designated Slack channel, keeping your team informed in real-time.
