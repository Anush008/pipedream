# Overview

Tally is a tool that makes creating forms simple and intuitive. By leveraging the Tally API on Pipedream, you can automate data collection and integrate form responses with countless other services to streamline your processes. With Pipedream's serverless platform, you can create workflows to handle form submissions, update databases, send notifications, and moreâ€”all in real-time. Harness the power of no-code automation, or write custom code to mold the API's output to your exact needs.

# Example Use Cases

- **Form Submission to Google Sheets:** Automatically push new Tally form submissions to Google Sheets. Once a user submits a form, the workflow triggers and appends the data to a specified Google Sheet, enabling easy tracking and analysis.
- **Slack Notifications for New Responses:** Stay notified with Slack messages each time someone fills out a Tally form. Set up a workflow that listens for new submissions and sends a formatted message to your chosen Slack channel, keeping your team instantly in the loop.
- **Trigger Email Follow-ups with SendGrid:** After a Tally form is submitted, use Pipedream to trigger a personalized email follow-up via SendGrid. This can be particularly useful for survey responses, user feedback, or event registrations, helping maintain engagement with respondents.
