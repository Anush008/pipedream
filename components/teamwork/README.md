# Overview

The Teamwork API on Pipedream enables you to automate project management tasks, sync data across apps, and build custom workflows to enhance team collaboration and productivity. By tapping into the Teamwork API, you can create, read, update, and delete resources like projects, tasks, messages, files, and time tracking data. Combine these capabilities with Pipedream's serverless platform to kick off workflows with any HTTP request, integrate with hundreds of other apps, and execute code to transform, filter, and aggregate data.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate Task Creation from Emails**: Automatically create tasks in Teamwork when you receive emails to a specific address. Use Pipedream's built-in email trigger to start the workflow and create tasks with details extracted from the email's content.

- **Sync New Contacts to CRM**: Whenever a new contact is added in Teamwork, trigger a workflow in Pipedream to add that contact to your CRM, such as Salesforce or HubSpot. Ensure that your customer data is always in sync and up to date.

- **Slack Notifications for Project Updates**: Set up a workflow that listens for changes in Teamwork projects, such as task completion or project milestones reached. Then, post a notification in a designated Slack channel to keep the team informed in real-time.
