# Overview

The Telegram Bot API on Pipedream allows you to seamlessly integrate Telegram's bot functionalities into your workflows. With this API, you can automate sending messages, create interactive chatbots, and manage conversations across your Telegram audience. Pipedream's serverless platform simplifies the process of setting up event-driven workflows, providing triggers for incoming Telegram messages and actions to respond or initiate new messages.

# Example Use Cases

- **Customer Support Bot**: Automate customer interactions by creating a support bot that listens for messages and responds with help or routes issues to the proper channels. Integrate with a CRM app like Salesforce to log conversations or follow-ups.

- **Content Distribution Network**: Share new content with your subscribers by triggering a workflow whenever you publish new articles, videos, or podcasts. Connect to a CMS like WordPress, and send a formatted message to a Telegram channel or group with the latest updates.

- **Survey and Feedback Collection**: Deploy a survey bot that collects user feedback and sends questions periodically. Use Pipedream's built-in data stores to log responses, or connect to Google Sheets for advanced analysis and persistent data storage.
