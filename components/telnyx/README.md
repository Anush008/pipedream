# Overview

The Telnyx API on Pipedream empowers you to automate communications at scale with voice, SMS, and other messaging services. You can programmatically manage calls, send messages, control SIP trunks, and more, making it possible to integrate robust communication features into your applications or workflows. With Pipedream's serverless platform, you can create event-driven workflows that harness the power of the Telnyx API without managing infrastructure.

# Example Use Cases

- **SMS Customer Support Automation**: Set up a workflow that listens for incoming SMS messages to your Telnyx number and automatically creates support tickets in a service like Zendesk. Implement an auto-responder to acknowledge the customer's message and inform them that their issue is being processed.

- **Voicemail Transcription and Notification**: Design a system where inbound voicemails are captured by Telnyx, transcribed using a service like Google Cloud Speech-to-Text, and then the text is sent to Slack or emailed to a designated inbox. This allows for prompt and searchable voicemail handling within team collaboration tools.

- **Dynamic Call Routing Based on Business Logic**: Create a workflow where incoming calls to your Telnyx number trigger a Pipedream workflow that consults a database or an API like Google Sheets to determine call routing based on time of day, caller ID, or other criteria. Calls can then be forwarded to the appropriate department or agent programmatically.
