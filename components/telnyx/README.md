# Overview

The Telnyx API provides robust telecommunication features, enabling developers to manage voice, SMS, and other real-time communication capabilities. On Pipedream, you can harness this power to build automated workflows that react to events or schedule tasks involving phone number operations, message sending, and call handling. Integrations with other services expand the potential, allowing for sophisticated, automated communication solutions that cater to a variety of use cases.

# Example Use Cases

- **SMS Customer Support Alerts**: Trigger a Pipedream workflow with a webhook when a support ticket is created in your helpdesk software (like Zendesk). Use the Telnyx API to send an SMS to the relevant support agent, providing immediate notification for high-priority issues.

- **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: Implement an additional layer of security for your application by using Telnyx to send 2FA codes via SMS. A Pipedream workflow can be set up to listen for login attempts and then call the Telnyx API to dispatch unique codes to users' mobile phones.

- **Voice Call Transcriptions**: Record voice calls using Telnyx and then trigger a Pipedream workflow to transcribe the audio to text using an app like Google Speech-to-Text. Store the transcription in a database or send it via email for record-keeping or analysis.
