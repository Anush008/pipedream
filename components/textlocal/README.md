# Overview

The Textlocal API opens up possibilities for automating SMS-based communication within Pipedream's serverless platform. Harness this API to send messages, manage contacts, and receive delivery reports. It's ideal for crafting notifications, alerts, and marketing campaigns directly from a workflow. With Pipedream's ability to connect to numerous services, you can trigger SMS actions based on events from apps like GitHub, Shopify, or even custom webhooks.

# Example Use Cases

- **SMS Notifications for GitHub Commit Activity**: Set up a workflow that listens for new commits to a GitHub repository. Once a commit is detected, trigger the Textlocal API to send an SMS to your development team, keeping everyone updated on the latest changes.

- **E-commerce Order Confirmation Texts**: Integrate Textlocal with Shopify. When a new order is placed, automatically send a confirmation SMS to the customer with order details and expected delivery time, enhancing customer service with timely communication.

- **Appointment Reminders via Google Calendar**: Create a workflow that monitors Google Calendar for upcoming appointments. Before an appointment starts, use Textlocal to send a reminder SMS to the participant, reducing no-shows and improving scheduling efficiency.
