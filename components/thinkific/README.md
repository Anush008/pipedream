# Overview

The Thinkific API unlocks the potential to automate and integrate your online course platform with a plethora of services and tools. On Pipedream, you can harness this API to craft custom workflows, such as synchronizing course data with other platforms, automating student onboarding processes, and generating real-time analytics. With Pipedream's serverless architecture, you can create these workflows without writing extensive code and trigger them based on a variety of events.

# Example Use Cases

- **Enroll New Email Subscribers in a Course**: Automatically enroll users in a Thinkific course whenever new subscribers are added to your Mailchimp list. This smooths the path for interested learners to get started without manual intervention.

- **Sync Course Completion to CRM**: Update your CRM records, like HubSpot or Salesforce, as soon as a student completes a course. Maintain a current view of learner progress and tailor your follow-up marketing efforts based on course completions.

- **Generate Custom Analytics Reports**: Compile custom analytics by sending course progress and quiz performance data from Thinkific to Google Sheets. Use this data for more personalized student outreach or to improve course content.
