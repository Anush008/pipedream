# Overview

The Todoist API unlocks the potential to automate task management and enhance productivity by interfacing with Todoist's robust task management features. With this API, you can create tasks, retrieve tasks, update task details, and manage projects programmatically on Pipedream. You can also trigger workflows from Todoist events, such as task completion or project updates, and connect Todoist with other apps to streamline your personal and professional to-dos.

# Example Use Cases

- **Task Completion Notifications**: Send a notification to a Slack channel when a task is marked complete in Todoist. This keeps your team updated on project progress without manual reporting.

- **Daily Task Digest**: Compile a list of tasks due each day and send it via email each morning. Use Pipedream's scheduled triggers to pull tasks from Todoist and an email service like SendGrid to automate your daily agenda.

- **GitHub Issue Sync**: When a GitHub issue is created, automatically add a corresponding task in Todoist. If the task is completed in Todoist, mark the GitHub issue as closed. This ensures developers keep track of issues to work on within their task management tool.
