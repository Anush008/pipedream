# Overview

The Todoist API on Pipedream allows you to interact with your tasks and projects in a programmatic way. With this API, you can create, read, update, and delete tasks, as well as organize them into projects and prioritize them according to your needs. By leveraging Pipedream's serverless platform, you can automate workflows, integrate with other services, and build custom apps that interact with your Todoist account, enhancing productivity and streamlining task management.

# Example Use Cases

- **Task Creation via Email**: Automatically create a Todoist task when you receive an email with a specific subject or from a certain sender. Connect your email service, like Gmail, to Pipedream and set up a workflow that parses incoming emails and creates tasks in Todoist with appropriate content and due dates.

- **Daily Task Digest**: Generate a daily digest of tasks due in Todoist and send it to your Slack channel every morning. Use a Pipedream scheduled workflow to fetch tasks due that day from Todoist, format them neatly, and post the digest to a designated Slack channel to keep the team informed and on track.

- **GitHub Issue Tracking**: Convert GitHub issues into Todoist tasks to manage your development to-dos better. Set up a Pipedream workflow that triggers when a new GitHub issue is opened. The workflow can add a corresponding task in Todoist, with links back to the GitHub issue for seamless tracking and updates.
