# Overview

The Todoist API on Pipedream allows you to create a bridge between your task management and various other services to streamline your productivity and automate repetitive actions. With this API, you can create, update, and manage tasks, projects, and comments in Todoist. Use Pipedream's serverless platform to connect Todoist with hundreds of other apps, trigger workflows on events in Todoist, or even use scheduled triggers to perform regular task cleanups or summaries.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Task Creation from Emails**: Automatically create Todoist tasks from incoming Gmail messages that are labeled as "To-Do". This workflow can save time by converting emails into actionable items without leaving your inbox.

- **Daily Task Digest to Slack**: Send a daily summary of your Todoist tasks to a Slack channel every morning. Keep your team updated with what's on your plate for the day, fostering transparency and collaboration.

- **GitHub Issue Synchronization**: Whenever a new GitHub issue is created, add a corresponding task in Todoist. This ensures your development tasks and your project management are always in sync, allowing you to track your coding work alongside other tasks.
