# Overview

The Todoist API on Pipedream allows you to automate tasks, synchronize data across apps, and create custom workflows. You can manage tasks, projects, comments, labels, and much more. By leveraging the API on Pipedream, you can integrate Todoist with a multitude of other services to streamline your productivity and task management systems.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Task Creation from Emails**: When you receive an email with a specific label or subject line in Gmail, Pipedream can automatically create a new task in Todoist with relevant details extracted from the email, ensuring you never miss an action item.

- **Slack Notifications for Overdue Tasks**: Set up a workflow that checks your Todoist for overdue tasks and sends you a notification on Slack. This can help you stay on top of deadlines and keep your tasks in check without constantly monitoring Todoist.

- **GitHub Issues to Todoist Tasks**: Whenever a new GitHub issue is opened in a specified repository, Pipedream can create a corresponding task in Todoist. This bridges the gap between issue tracking and personal task management, making it easier to prioritize your development work.
