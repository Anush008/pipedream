# Overview

The Todoist API on Pipedream allows you to automate tasks and integrate your to-do lists with other applications seamlessly. With this API, you can create tasks, manage projects, and trigger actions based on changes within Todoist. By leveraging Pipedream's serverless platform, you can build custom workflows that connect Todoist with hundreds of other apps without writing complex code. This automates repetitive tasks, streamlines productivity, and ensures your lists are always in sync with your digital environment.

# Example Use Cases

- **Sync New Tasks to Google Calendar**: Create events on your Google Calendar for new tasks added in Todoist. When a task is created in a specific project, Pipedream triggers a workflow that automatically adds an event to a designated Google Calendar, ensuring your schedule is always up-to-date with your to-dos.

- **Slack Notifications for Completed Tasks**: Send a message to a Slack channel whenever tasks are completed in Todoist. This workflow helps keep your team informed about task progress, celebrating completed milestones, and enhancing collaboration through immediate updates in your team's communication hub.

- **Aggregate Daily Tasks into a Digest Email**: Compile a daily digest of all tasks due today and send it via email each morning. This Pipedream workflow gathers tasks due on the current day from Todoist, formats them into a concise list, and emails it to you, providing a clear overview of the day's priorities directly in your inbox.
