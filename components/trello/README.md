# Overview

The Trello API on Pipedream allows you to automate tasks, sync data across applications, and create dynamic workflows from your Trello boards, lists, and cards. With this API, you can create, update, move, and delete cards, lists, and boards; manage memberships; and interact with Trello data in real-time. Pipedream's serverless platform enables you to connect Trello with hundreds of other apps for limitless automation possibilities.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate Task Assignment**: When a new card is created in a specific Trello list, use Pipedream to assign the card to a team member based on predefined rules, and send an email notification through Gmail to the assignee with task details.

- **Sync Trello with a Calendar**: Keep your deadlines in check by automatically creating Google Calendar events whenever due dates are added to Trello cards. This workflow ensures that every key milestone in Trello is reflected in your calendar, helping you to stay on top of your schedule.

- **Slack Notifications for Card Updates**: Keep your team informed by setting up a workflow where any update to a Trello card—like a comment, attachment, or status change—triggers an automatic message to a designated Slack channel. This ensures that relevant stakeholders are always in the loop with the latest project developments.
