# Overview

The Trello API on Pipedream allows you to automate actions and integrate with other services to optimize project management and team collaboration. With it, you can create, update, and manage Trello boards, lists, cards, members, and more. This opens up a plethora of automation possibilities that can streamline your workflows, reduce manual tasks, and connect Trello to other apps and services.

# Example Use Cases

- **Sync Trello Cards with Google Calendar**: Create events in Google Calendar whenever new Trello cards are added to specific lists. This keeps your schedule aligned with project tasks without manual entry.

- **Automate Card Creation from GitHub Issues**: Whenever a new issue is created in a GitHub repository, automatically create a corresponding card in a Trello board. This helps you track development tasks within your project management tool.

- **Aggregate Feedback into Trello**: Collect form submissions from Typeform, and automatically create Trello cards for each submission. Use this to gather and organize user feedback or support tickets efficiently.
