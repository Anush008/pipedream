# Overview

Trello's API on Pipedream allows you to create dynamic, automated workflows that interact with your Trello boards, cards, lists, and members. You can leverage this to sync data between Trello and other apps, respond to events in Trello with custom logic, or automate repetitive tasks. On Pipedream, you can trigger workflows on specific Trello events and perform actions like creating cards, updating lists, and managing members, all with minimal setup and real-time execution.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate Task Assignment**: When a new card is created in Trello, use Pipedream to assign it to a team member based on predefined criteria. You can further connect to Slack to notify the member of the new task.

- **Sync Trello with a Calendar**: Create a workflow that adds Trello card due dates as events in Google Calendar. Whenever a card's due date is updated in Trello, the corresponding Google Calendar event is automatically adjusted.

- **Aggregate Feedback from Multiple Boards**: Collect and summarize comments from various Trello cards into a central Google Sheet. This workflow can help you track feedback or requests across different project boards.
