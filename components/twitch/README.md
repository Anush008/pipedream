With Pipedream, you can harness this power to create custom, serverless workflows. This can range from sending alerts when your favorite streamer goes live to analyzing chat messages in real-time. By connecting Twitch with other apps on Pipedream, you can automate tasks, collect data, and interact with the Twitch community in ways that save time and enhance engagement.
