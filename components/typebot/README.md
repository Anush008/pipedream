# Overview

The Typebot API allows you to create and manage conversational forms, surveys, and bots that enhance user engagement and collect data. With Pipedream, you can automate interactions with Typebot forms, streamline data processing, and connect Typebot to hundreds of other services to trigger actions based on form responses or survey completions. This opens up possibilities for automating feedback collection, streamlining customer service, or even generating leads without manual intervention.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Contact Information Syncing**: When a user completes a Typebot form submitting their contact information, Pipedream can capture this data and automatically update your CRM, such as Salesforce or HubSpot. This creates a new contact or updates an existing one, ensuring your sales team has the latest information at their fingertips.

- **Dynamic Survey Result Analysis**: After a survey is completed in Typebot, Pipedream can trigger a workflow that processes the responses, perhaps sending them to a Google Sheet for analysis. You can also use sentiment analysis tools like MonkeyLearn to gauge customer sentiment and automatically categorize feedback.

- **Real-time Notifications for Form Submissions**: Every time a Typebot form is submitted, Pipedream can immediately send a notification to a Slack channel, informing your team about the new submission. This enables prompt follow-up on potential leads or support tickets, reducing response times and improving customer satisfaction.
