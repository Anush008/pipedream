# Overview

The Typeform API taps into the power of Typeform's versatile form and survey creation platform, allowing for detailed data retrieval and manipulation. With Pipedream's integration, you can trigger workflows on new form submissions, fetch form responses in real-time, and even manage your forms. This API is a gateway to gather insights, automate feedback loops, or enrich customer data - All in a serverless environment on Pipedream, where you can integrate with countless other apps and services.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate Lead Capture**: When a new Typeform submission occurs, use Pipedream to capture the lead information and insert it directly into your CRM, such as Salesforce or HubSpot. This can cut down response times and ensure your sales team has immediate access to potential customer data.

- **Feedback Collection and Analysis**: Collect user feedback via Typeform and trigger a Pipedream workflow that sends the data to Google Sheets for storage. Then, integrate with a sentiment analysis service to gauge customer satisfaction and automatically flag negative responses for follow-up.

- **Course Enrollment Process**: For educational platforms, when a new Typeform submission comes in for course enrollment, you can automate the creation of student profiles in your Learning Management System (LMS) and send personalized welcome emails using an email platform like SendGrid.
