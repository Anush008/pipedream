# Overview

The Typeform API on Pipedream allows you to automate interactions with your Typeform surveys and forms. With this integration, you can trigger workflows on new form submissions, retrieve and analyze responses, and synchronize your form data with other apps. Pipedream's serverless platform enables you to create complex workflows without writing a single line of backend code.

# Example Use Cases

- **Auto-respond to Form Submissions**: Trigger an email or SMS to the respondent using the SendGrid or Twilio app when a new Typeform submission is received, providing them with a thank you message or further instructions.

- **Sync Submissions to Google Sheets**: Save new Typeform responses to a Google Sheets document in real-time. This is perfect for maintaining an up-to-date database of responses that can be shared and analyzed by teams.

- **Aggregate Feedback and Create Reports**: Use the Typeform API to collect feedback, and then compile the data using Pipedream's built-in SQL service to generate insights or reports. You can then connect to apps like Slack to share those insights with your team automatically.
