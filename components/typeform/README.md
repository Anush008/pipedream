# Overview

The Typeform API on Pipedream lets you automate interactions with Typeform surveys and forms, enabling you to integrate survey data into your apps and workflows seamlessly. With the API, you can capture real-time responses, analyze submissions to glean insights, and trigger actions based on respondent behavior. By leveraging Pipedream's capabilities, you can connect Typeform with a multitude of other services to create powerful, automated workflows without writing a single line of code.

# Example Use Cases

- **Customer Feedback to Slack Alert**: When a new Typeform entry is submitted for customer feedback, trigger a Pipedream workflow to parse the response and automatically send a formatted alert to a designated Slack channel. This keeps the team informed and responsive to customer needs.

- **Event Registration to Google Sheets**: Upon receiving a new Typeform registration for an event, use a Pipedream workflow to add the participant's details to a Google Sheets spreadsheet. This can act as an automated guest list that's always up to date and easily shareable with collaborators.

- **Lead Qualification and Email Follow-up**: When a potential lead completes a Typeform survey, set up a Pipedream workflow to assess the lead quality based on their responses. If they meet certain criteria, trigger an email sequence via SendGrid to engage them further, ensuring no warm lead goes unattended.
