# Overview

The Typeform API on Pipedream allows you to automate interactions with Typeform surveys and forms. You can retrieve form responses, create and update forms, and configure webhooks to trigger workflows on new form submissions. By leveraging Pipedream's serverless platform, you can integrate Typeform with numerous other apps, analyze submissions, send notifications, and more, all in real-time.

# Example Use Cases

- **Sync Typeform Submissions to Google Sheets**: When a new form is submitted, the workflow triggers and processes the Typeform data, then appends it to a specified Google Sheets spreadsheet. This can be used for survey result analysis or lead capture.

- **Automated Slack Notifications for New Responses**: Set up a workflow where new Typeform entries automatically send a message to a Slack channel or direct message to a team member. This keeps your team instantly informed about new feedback or inquiries.

- **Email Follow-Up After Form Submission**: Once a form is submitted, this workflow can send a customized email to the respondent. This email could be a thank you message, additional resources, or a confirmation receipt, combined with the power of an email service like SendGrid or Gmail.
