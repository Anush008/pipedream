UltraMsg API unlocks the power to automate interactions over WhatsApp. By integrating with Pipedream, you can create serverless workflows that handle everything from auto-responding to messages, sending notifications, or even managing customer support tickets. With UltraMsg's connection to WhatsApp, your apps can engage in two-way conversations, push media content, or trigger actions based on message content, all flowing seamlessly through Pipedream's easy-to-use platform.

# Example Use Cases

- **WhatsApp Notifications for E-commerce Orders**: Send order confirmations and shipping updates directly to your customers on WhatsApp. Combine UltraMsg with Stripe on Pipedream. When a new payment is captured in Stripe, trigger a workflow that sends a personalized message via UltraMsg.

- **Customer Support Ticketing via WhatsApp**: Integrate UltraMsg with a CRM like HubSpot. When a new message is received on WhatsApp, the workflow can create or update a ticket in HubSpot, ensuring that support teams can track and respond to customer inquiries effectively.
