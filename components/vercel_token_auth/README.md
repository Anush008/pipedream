# Overview

The Vercel API provides programmatic access to operations that you can perform within the Vercel platform, which is known for deploying, managing, and scaling modern web projects. With this API on Pipedream, you can automate workflows involving deployment hooks, manage domains, projects, and serverless functions, and even react to events within Vercel, such as successful deployments or error logs. Itâ€™s a powerful way to integrate your development operations with other tools and services, creating a seamless CI/CD pipeline or managing your web projects programmatically.

# Example Use Cases

- **Deploy on Git Push**: Automatically trigger a Vercel deployment when changes are pushed to a specific branch of your GitHub repository. This ensures that your latest code is always deployed without manual intervention.

- **Monitor Deployment Status**: Create a workflow that checks the status of your Vercel deployments and sends alerts via Slack or email if a deployment fails or has warnings, keeping your team informed and ready to troubleshoot.

- **Sync Project Settings**: Integrate Vercel with Airtable to sync project settings. Any updates to your project configurations in Airtable can be automatically reflected on your Vercel projects, keeping your deployment settings consistent and up-to-date.
