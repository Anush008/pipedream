# Overview

WakaTime API allows you to track coding activity programmatically, gather detailed insights on how you or your team is spending time coding, and you can use this data to improve productivity or report on progress. With Pipedream's serverless integration platform, you can automate workflows using WakaTime data, connecting to hundreds of other apps to streamline and enhance your productivity analytics.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Weekly Coding Reports:** Generate weekly reports summarizing your coding activity, languages used, and project focus. Connect WakaTime to Google Sheets using Pipedream to append this data into a spreadsheet for historical tracking or future analysis.

- **Real-Time Slack Notifications:** Stay informed about your team's coding activity. Set up a Pipedream workflow to send Slack notifications when someone reaches a coding milestone or when there's an unusual pattern in coding activity, promoting transparency and motivation.

- **Project Time Tracking Integration:** Integrate WakaTime with project management tools like Trello or Jira using Pipedream. Automatically log time spent on coding tasks to corresponding tickets or cards, keeping your project progress up-to-date with minimal manual entry.
