# Overview

The WakaTime API lets you track coding activity transparently and measure coding metrics across various IDEs and text editors. With Pipedream, you can craft serverless workflows that leverage WakaTime’s data, such as coding hours, languages used, and project activity, to automate personalized reports, integrate with project management tools, or even trigger reminders when it’s time to take a break. By connecting WakaTime with other apps on Pipedream, you can create custom dashboards, set activity-based triggers, and streamline your development workflow.

# Example Use Cases

- **Daily Coding Summary Email**: Send a daily email summarizing your coding activity using Gmail or another email service. The workflow triggers at a specified time, fetches the day's coding metrics from WakaTime, formats the data, and sends the email, providing insights into your productivity.

- **Slack Productivity Notifications**: Keep your team updated with daily or weekly Slack notifications. This workflow retrieves coding statistics from WakaTime and posts a formatted message to a designated Slack channel, highlighting team progress and individual contributions.

- **Project Time Tracking Integration**: Integrate WakaTime data with time tracking tools like Toggl or Harvest. Set up a workflow that periodically syncs your coding activity from WakaTime and logs it as time entries in your tracking app, paving the way for accurate project billing and time management.
