# Overview

The Webflow API offers programmatic access to your Webflow projects, allowing you to manage your sites, CMS collections, and e-commerce functions. With Pipedream, you can harness this power to automate workflows, sync data across platforms, and manipulate Webflow components based on triggers from other services. Pipedream's serverless platform enables you to connect Webflow with hundreds of other apps without writing complex code, using pre-built actions or Node.js code steps for custom logic.

# Example Use Cases

- **Form Submission Handling**  
  Connect Webflow forms to Pipedream to process submissions, sending the data to CRM systems like Salesforce or email marketing services like Mailchimp for prompt follow-up actions.

- **E-commerce Order Processing**
