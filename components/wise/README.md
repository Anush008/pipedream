# Overview

The Wise API on Pipedream allows for seamless integration of international money transfer services directly into your workflows. With it, you can automate cross-border payments, manage your account balances, and retrieve real-time exchange rates, all from within Pipedream's serverless platform. This enables developers to construct tailored financial solutions, connect the Wise platform to other apps, and trigger actions based on financial events, enhancing efficiency and expanding the capabilities of your financial operations.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Invoice Settlements**: Use Wise with Pipedream to monitor incoming invoice payments through a connected accounting app like QuickBooks. When a new payment is recorded, automatically trigger a workflow to convert and send funds in the required currency to an international vendor, minimizing manual intervention and exchange rate risks.

- **Real-Time Financial Dashboard Updates**: Combine Wise with a dashboard app like Geckoboard on Pipedream. Set up a workflow to fetch current account balances and exchange rates at regular intervals, and then update your financial dashboard, providing a live view of your company's financial health.

- **Expense Reimbursement Automation**: Use Wise to streamline employee expense reimbursements. By integrating with an expense tracking app like Expensify on Pipedream, automatically approve and initiate cross-border reimbursement payments to employees when a new approved expense report is detected, ensuring timely and accurate payments.
