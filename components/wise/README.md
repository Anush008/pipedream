# Overview

The Wise API on Pipedream allows you to automate international payment processing and manage multi-currency accounts with ease. With this integration, you can programmatically interact with your Wise account to create transfers, retrieve account balances, and manage recipients. Utilizing Pipedream's capabilities, you can connect the Wise API with hundreds of other apps to streamline financial operations, set up event-driven workflows, and synchronize financial data across platforms.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Invoice Payments**: Set up a workflow where invoices from an accounting platform like QuickBooks trigger payments through the Wise API. When a new invoice is marked as due, Pipedream retrieves the necessary payment details and initiates a transfer via Wise, ensuring timely payments without manual intervention.

- **Balance Monitoring and Alerts**: Create a Pipedream workflow that periodically checks your Wise account balances and sends alerts via email or a messaging app like Slack if the balance falls below a certain threshold. This can help maintain liquidity and prevent overdrafts.

- **Synchronization with Expense Tracking**: Build a workflow where transactions made through Wise are automatically logged into an expense tracking app like Expensify. Every time a transfer completes, Pipedream fetches the transaction details from Wise and creates a new expense record, keeping your finance team updated in real-time.
