# Overview

Wit.ai API empowers developers to build applications that can understand and process human language by leveraging natural language processing (NLP). With this API, you can create conversational interfaces for various platforms. On Pipedream, you can integrate wit.ai with hundreds of other services to automate language-related workflows. Trigger workflows with webhooks, schedule them, or run them manually to parse user messages, extract intents, entities, and more, then act on this data in interesting and powerful ways.

# Example Use Cases

- **Customer Support Automation**: Create a workflow where incoming customer support inquiries from a platform like Zendesk are sent to wit.ai to extract intent and sentiment. Based on the analysis, automatically tag the support ticket and route it to the appropriate team or reply with an automated, contextually relevant response.

- **Voice Command Processing**: Set up a Pipedream workflow that takes voice recordings from a service like Twilio, transcribes the audio, and sends it to wit.ai. Extract commands or queries from the transcription and use that to control smart home devices, query databases, or interact with other APIs to fulfill the user's request.

- **Social Media Monitoring**: Build a workflow that streams tweets from Twitter using a specific hashtag. Pass those tweets to wit.ai to gain insights into public sentiment or trending topics. Use the parsed data to maintain a live dashboard, trigger alerts on certain triggers, or aggregate marketing intelligence.
