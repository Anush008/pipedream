# Overview

The You Need a Budget (YNAB) API provides programmatic access to budgeting functionalities. With this API on Pipedream, you can automate and sync your budget data, manage transactions, and tailor financial insights. The API allows you to retrieve account balances, transaction details, and budget categories, as well as create and update transactions. By connecting YNAB with Pipedream, you can integrate your budgeting with other apps and services, streamlining your financial workflows and data management.

# Example Use Cases

- **Transaction Alert to Slack**: Automatically send a message to a Slack channel when a new transaction is added to YNAB. This keeps your team or family updated on spending in real-time and encourages financial awareness.

- **Monthly Spending Summary Email**: At the end of each month, compile a summary of spending by category from YNAB and send it via email. This workflow helps you keep track of where your money is going and allows for better budgeting decisions.

- **Sync Transactions to Google Sheets**: When a new transaction is added to YNAB, append the details to a Google Sheet. This can create a detailed record for archiving and analysis, providing a backup and an alternative view of your financial data.
