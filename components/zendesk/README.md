# Overview

Zendesk API on Pipedream enables you to automate and streamline customer support operations by integrating with this popular customer service platform. Pipedream's serverless workflow environment allows you to trigger events, sync data, and perform actions on tickets, users, and more. With this API, you can create custom workflows to respond quickly to customer inquiries, manage ticket lifecycles, extract insights, and connect Zendesk with other tools, all in real-time and without managing servers.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automate Ticket Tagging and Prioritization**: Use Zendesk triggers to scan incoming tickets for keywords and automatically tag and prioritize them, ensuring that critical issues are addressed first. Pipedream workflows can interact with the Zendesk API to update tickets based on predefined criteria.

- **Sync Zendesk Tickets with a CRM**: Keep your CRM up-to-date by automatically creating or updating records when a new ticket is created in Zendesk. For example, connect Zendesk to Salesforce using Pipedream to ensure that your sales and support teams have the most current customer information.

- **Slack Notifications for Urgent Tickets**: Set up a Pipedream workflow that listens for new tickets or specific ticket updates in Zendesk, and sends an alert message to a designated Slack channel. This ensures that your team can respond to urgent issues promptly.
