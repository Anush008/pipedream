# Overview

The ZeroTier API offers a network as a service, providing secure networking capabilities among devices, regardless of their physical location. With Pipedream, you can harness this API to automate tasks like network management, device provisioning, and monitoring. You can trigger workflows on events, manage networks, or orchestrate actions across other apps and services seamlessly.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated Network Member Approval**: Build a workflow that listens for new devices trying to join a ZeroTier network and automatically approves them if they meet certain criteria. This streamlines network expansions and device onboarding.

- **Dynamic Network Configuration Updates**: Set up a Pipedream workflow where changes in an external data source (like a Google Sheet or database) trigger ZeroTier network configuration updates. Use this to manage access controls or adjust network settings in bulk without manual intervention.

- **Cross-Service Security Alerts and Actions**: Create a workflow that monitors ZeroTier network activity, triggers alerts for suspicious behavior, and takes action by integrating with services like Slack for notifications or AWS Lambda to execute custom security responses.
