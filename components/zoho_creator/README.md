Zoho Creator is a cloud software to build custom apps that can run on any device. It offers an API that lets you integrate and manipulate your app data programmatically. With the Zoho Creator API on Pipedream, you can automate workflows, sync data across apps, and trigger actions based on events in your Zoho Creator apps. You can connect Zoho Creator to a multitude of services available on Pipedream to expand functionality, like sending notifications through Slack, storing information in Google Sheets, or triggering email campaigns with Mailchimp.

# Example Use Cases
