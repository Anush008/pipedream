# Overview

The Zoho CRM API enables the manipulation and retrieval of data within Zoho CRM, a platform for managing your sales, marketing, support, and inventory in a single system. Leveraging this on Pipedream, you can automate tasks like syncing contacts, updating lead statuses, or creating custom CRM operations that trigger actions in other apps. Pipedream's serverless platform allows for real-time data processing, transforming, and orchestrating workflows that respond to events in Zoho CRM with minimal latency.

# Example Use Cases

- **Lead Qualification and Assignment Workflow**: When a new lead is entered into Zoho CRM, Pipedream can automatically qualify the lead based on predefined criteria (like job title or company size) and assign it to the appropriate sales representative. This can be extended by notifying the assigned rep via Slack or email, ensuring prompt follow-ups.

- **Contact Sync Across Platforms**: Keep contact information in sync between Zoho CRM and other platforms such as Google Contacts, Mailchimp, or Shopify. Whenever a contact is updated in Zoho CRM, Pipedream can propagate those changes to the other platforms in real-time, maintaining consistency and accuracy across your sales and marketing tools.

- **Automated Support Ticket Creation**: Integrate Zoho CRM with a customer support platform like Zendesk. When a deal reaches a certain stage in Zoho CRM indicating potential issues, Pipedream can automatically generate a support ticket in Zendesk with the relevant deal and customer information, streamlining the support process and ensuring issues are addressed promptly.
