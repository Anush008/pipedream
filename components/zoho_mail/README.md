# Example Use Cases

- **Email to Task Conversion**: Create tasks in project management tools like Trello or Asana when receiving emails with specific keywords or from certain senders. This can automate the process of tracking important requests or action items coming through your email.

- **Support Ticket Generation**: On receiving an email with a support query or issue report, instantly generate a ticket in a customer support platform like Zendesk or Freshdesk. This helps in ensuring that customer issues are addressed promptly and not lost in the shuffle of an inbox.

- **Email Campaign Analytics**: After sending out a marketing campaign, you might want to track responses and engagement. Use the API to tag and categorize responses, then send this data to analytics tools like Google Sheets or a BI platform to measure campaign effectiveness.
