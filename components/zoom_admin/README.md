# Overview

The Zoom Admin API lets you harness the extensive capabilities of Zoom for automation and integration, right within Pipedream. Automate user management, track Zoom rooms, monitor webinars and meetings, and customize your workflow to respond dynamically to events like new participants or ended meetings. With these APIs and the power of Pipedream, you can streamline administrative tasks, extract valuable insights, and sync Zoom activities with other services.

# Example Use Cases

- **Automated User Provisioning and Deprovisioning**: Sync user data from your HR platform (e.g., BambooHR) with Zoom. When a new employee is added in BambooHR, automatically create a Zoom user account for them. Conversely, when an employee leaves, trigger a workflow to deactivate their Zoom account.

- **Meeting Analytics and Reporting**: Connect Zoom Admin with a data visualization tool like Tableau. Each time a meeting ends, aggregate meeting statistics and send them to Tableau to create real-time dashboards that help management analyze usage patterns and meeting effectiveness.

- **Webinar Attendee Follow-Up**: Link Zoom webinars with email platforms such as SendGrid. After a webinar ends, send a customized follow-up email to all attendees with a survey or additional resources, and update your CRM (like Salesforce) with attendee engagement data.
